It is typically encountered only due to conjuration by a cleric, although these creatures roam the ethereal and astral planes and when encountered there can be dimly seen. An aerial servant is normally invisible. Aerial servants do not fight per se, but they are exceedingly strong and very fast. They can carry weights in excess of 10,000 gold pieces, and if they grasp any creature it requires an 18 strength to have <i>any</i> chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the creature has, there is a like chance to escape the grasp of the aerial servant, i.e. a human with an 18/50% strength has a 50% chance of breaking free of the grasp, and a 00% or 19 indicates automatic breaking of the grasp. They travel at twice the speed on an <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker/">invisible stalker</a>, and when on the physical plane they are able to achieve surprise on a die roll of 1-4 (out of 6). If the aerial servant is frustrated from completion of its assigned mission it becomes insane, returns to the cleric which sent it forth, and attacks as a double strength <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker/\">invisible stalker</a>. Likewise, if it is encountered ethereally or astrally the aerial servant will typically attack in the same fashion. For further details regarding aerial servants consult the volume detailing clerical spells.'

This causes farmers great consternation, since the anhkheg likes to supplement its earthly diet of soil with a bit of fresh meat, human or otherwise. Since its mouth is not designed to rip and tear meat, its mandibles crush its prey and secrete a digestive enzyme causing an additional 1-4 points per round until the prey is completely dissolved. If sorely pressed in battle it is able to squirt its digestive acids 30 feet once per six hours. However when it does this it cannot digest anything for the same length of time, so it usually will bite. A squirt of digestive acid causes 8-32 hit points of damage to the creature struck, half the amount if the creature makes its saving throw. The anhkheg\'s favorite method of attacking is lying 5-10 feet underneath the ground until its antenna detects a likely victim passing overhead. Then it burrows out directly underneath the prey and grabs it.\n\nThe anhkheg has a chitinous shell which is brownish in color. Its underside is pinkish. The creature\'s eyes are glistening black.'

The globular body of this monster is supported by levitation, and it floats slowly about as it wills. Atop the sphere are 10 eyestalks, while in its central area are a great eleventh eye and a large mouth filled with pointed teeth. The body is protected by a hard chitinous covering. The creature\'s eyestalks and eyes are also protected, although less well (thus the armor classes of 2 and 7 respectively). Because of its particular nature the beholder is able to withstand the loss of its eyestalks, these members are not computed as part of its hit point damage potential, and lost eyestalks will eventually grow back (1 week per lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand one-third this total, i.e. a beholder with 45 hit points can withstand 30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed; the eleventh eye can withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. Eyestalks take from 8 to 12 hit points each before being lost. The body of the beholder represents 75% of potential hit area, the central eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.\n\n<i>Eyes</i>: The various eyes of a beholder each have a different function. Typically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks are able to function considering that the attack is coming from an arc 90° before the monster. If attacks come from 180° double the number of eyestalks able to function, and for 270° or 360° triple or quadruple the number. Attacks from above enable all 10 eyestalks to function, but the central eye cannot.

The body structure of a black pudding is such that it can pass (flow) through narrow openings (such as a 1" crack under a door). The monster travels equally well on walls or ceilings as well as floors. Its tiny mouths and saliva do 3-24 hit points of damage per melee round to exposed flesh.

Black puddings also eat away metal with their corrosive saliva: Chainmail in 1 melee round, plate mail in 2, and an additional melee round for magical armor at a rate of 1 melee round for each plus of armor. Thus, +1 magic (plate) armor would have to be in contact with a black pudding for 3 melee rounds before it dissolved. If chopped or struck, the monster is broken into two or more parts, each able to attack. The same is true if it is attacked by lightning. Cold does not affect it. Fire causes normal damage to this monster, and they avoid flames. Black puddings sometimes have color variation, gray, brown, and white being not uncommon.\n\nBlack puddings with 10-20 hit points are about 5\' diameter, those of 21-40 hit points 6\', 41-60 are 7\', and 61-80 are 8\'.

The catoblepas\' neck is long and thin, and perched atop it is a big head uglier than that of a warthog. Its legs are thick and stumpy, much like a hippopotamus. The creature\'s tail is strong and snakey however, and moves with amazing swiftness to strike enemies. Any creature so struck has a base 75% chance of being stunned for 1-10 melee rounds; the base chance being modified by adjustment downward by 5% for every level (or hit die for monsters) above 1. Thus, if an 11th level character is struck by the tail there is only a 25% chance of stunning. Perhaps its habitat - fetid swamps and miasmal marshes - caused the bizarre combination of genetic characteristics in this monster, or perhaps it was due to some ghastly tinkering with life by a demented godling. In any case, the most horrid aspect of the catoblepas is its bloodshot eyes.\n\nThe gaze of the catoblepas is equal to a <a href="/spells/death-spell-magic-user-lvl-6/">death</a> ray, extending 6" from the eyes (even into the astral and ethereal planes). Any creature which meets this gaze dies without a chance to save itself. Complete surprise (a 2 on 6-sided die) means one of the party encountering the monster has met its gaze. Otherwise the very weak neck on the catoblepas has only a 25% chance of raising the head enough to use its eyes. If both parties are still this chance increases by 15% per melee round. If the monster must follow quick movements, or if it is shambling along in pursuit of prey, there is only a 10% chance per melee round of the neck raising the head sufficiently high to fix its gaze. A fleeing victim, even with eyes averted, is subject to the deadly effect of the catoblepas\' eyes, although there is a saving throw.'

        '<b>Tallfellow</b>: A taller (4+\'), slimmer halfling, with fairer skin and hair. Tallfellows are very rare. They use more armor (AC 6), ride ponies and carry more spears. It is possible for exceptionally strong (17, 18) tallfellows to work to 5th or 6th level of fighting ability. They can speak <a href="/creatures/elf">elvish</a> and are very friendly with elves. They live for about 180 years on the average.\n\n'
        '<b>Stout</b>: This kind of halfling is a bit smaller (3½+\') and stockier than the typical (hairfeet). They use more armor also (AC 6), and employ morning stars in addition to the usual halflingish arms. Very strong stouts (18) are able to work up to 5th level fighting ability. Stouts have infravision and can detect sloping passageways. They have no fear of water and can swim. These halflings are able to speak <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarvish</a> and enjoy dwarven company. Stouts reach the age of 200 or more years.'

Once set upon a mission, an invisible stalker will follow through unceasingly until it is accomplished. They are faultless trackers within one day of a quarry\'s passing. They must be destroyed to make them cease an ordered attack. Once a mission is finished, the creature is freed to return to its own plane. The invisible stalker is at best an unwilling servant but will not resent a brief, uncomplicated task. Service involving a period of a week tries the creature severely, and anything longer is certain to make it attempt to fulfill the letter of command by perverting the spirit of it. This is not to say that impelling the invisible stalker to serve for extended periods is impossible, but the compulsion to cause it to do so fully and properly must be great, i.e. a carefully worded command from a very powerful magic-user. A simple command such as "Follow me, and guard me from any attack," could be interpreted to follow at 100\' distance if the invisible stalker had been on duty over a week - or perhaps even if it hadn\'t been that long, for dealing with such creatures is always a hazard. Similarly, a command to: "Keep me safe from all harm," can be construed by the invisible stalker that it is to carry the conjuring party to its own plane and place them in suspended animation in a secret room in its own abode, thus carrying out its duties to the letter.\n\n'
        'Each day of duty which an invisible stalker serves will see a 1% cumulative chance of the creature seeking to pervert the intent of its commands in order to be free of servitude. If no option remains open, the stalker must continue to serve.\n\n'

If the medusa\'s gaze is reflected back, the creature will turn itself to stone! Medusae speak both their tongue and the common one.
