It is typically encountered only due to conjuration by a cleric, although these creatures roam the ethereal and astral planes and when encountered there can be dimly seen. An aerial servant is normally invisible. Aerial servants do not fight per se, but they are exceedingly strong and very fast. They can carry weights in excess of 10,000 gold pieces, and if they grasp any creature it requires an 18 strength to have <i>any</i> chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the creature has, there is a like chance to escape the grasp of the aerial servant, i.e. a human with an 18/50% strength has a 50% chance of breaking free of the grasp, and a 00% or 19 indicates automatic breaking of the grasp. They travel at twice the speed on an <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker">invisible stalker</a>, and when on the physical plane they are able to achieve surprise on a die roll of 1-4 (out of 6). If the aerial servant is frustrated from completion of its assigned mission it becomes insane, returns to the cleric which sent it forth, and attacks as a double strength <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker/\">invisible stalker</a>. Likewise, if it is encountered ethereally or astrally the aerial servant will typically attack in the same fashion.

This causes farmers great consternation, since the anhkheg likes to supplement its earthly diet of soil with a bit of fresh meat, human or otherwise. Since its mouth is not designed to rip and tear meat, its mandibles crush its prey and secrete a digestive enzyme causing an additional 1-4 points per round until the prey is completely dissolved. If sorely pressed in battle it is able to squirt its digestive acids 30 feet once per six hours. However when it does this it cannot digest anything for the same length of time, so it usually will bite. A squirt of digestive acid causes 8-32 hit points of damage to the creature struck, half the amount if the creature makes its saving throw. The anhkheg\'s favorite method of attacking is lying 5-10 feet underneath the ground until its antenna detects a likely victim passing overhead. Then it burrows out directly underneath the prey and grabs it.\n\nThe anhkheg has a chitinous shell which is brownish in color. Its underside is pinkish. The creature\'s eyes are glistening black.'

The globular body of this monster is supported by levitation, and it floats slowly about as it wills. Atop the sphere are 10 eyestalks, while in its central area are a great eleventh eye and a large mouth filled with pointed teeth. The body is protected by a hard chitinous covering. The creature\'s eyestalks and eyes are also protected, although less well (thus the armor classes of 2 and 7 respectively). Because of its particular nature the beholder is able to withstand the loss of its eyestalks, these members are not computed as part of its hit point damage potential, and lost eyestalks will eventually grow back (1 week per lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand one-third this total, i.e. a beholder with 45 hit points can withstand 30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed; the eleventh eye can withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. Eyestalks take from 8 to 12 hit points each before being lost. The body of the beholder represents 75% of potential hit area, the central eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.\n\n<i>Eyes</i>: The various eyes of a beholder each have a different function. Typically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks are able to function considering that the attack is coming from an arc 90° before the monster. If attacks come from 180° double the number of eyestalks able to function, and for 270° or 360° triple or quadruple the number. Attacks from above enable all 10 eyestalks to function, but the central eye cannot.

The body structure of a black pudding is such that it can pass (flow) through narrow openings (such as a 1" crack under a door). The monster travels equally well on walls or ceilings as well as floors. Its tiny mouths and saliva do 3-24 hit points of damage per melee round to exposed flesh.

Black puddings also eat away metal with their corrosive saliva: Chainmail in 1 melee round, plate mail in 2, and an additional melee round for magical armor at a rate of 1 melee round for each plus of armor. Thus, +1 magic (plate) armor would have to be in contact with a black pudding for 3 melee rounds before it dissolved. If chopped or struck, the monster is broken into two or more parts, each able to attack. The same is true if it is attacked by lightning. Cold does not affect it. Fire causes normal damage to this monster, and they avoid flames. Black puddings sometimes have color variation, gray, brown, and white being not uncommon.\n\nBlack puddings with 10-20 hit points are about 5\' diameter, those of 21-40 hit points 6\', 41-60 are 7\', and 61-80 are 8\'. Note that even those of the smallest size (or those as small as 1\' diameter) are able to deliver normal damage.

The catoblepas\' neck is long and thin, and perched atop it is a big head uglier than that of a warthog. Its legs are thick and stumpy, much like a hippopotamus. The creature\'s tail is strong and snakey however, and moves with amazing swiftness to strike enemies. Any creature so struck has a base 75% chance of being stunned for 1-10 melee rounds; the base chance being modified by adjustment downward by 5% for every level (or hit die for monsters) above 1. Thus, if an 11th level character is struck by the tail there is only a 25% chance of stunning. Perhaps its habitat - fetid swamps and miasmal marshes - caused the bizarre combination of genetic characteristics in this monster, or perhaps it was due to some ghastly tinkering with life by a demented godling. In any case, the most horrid aspect of the catoblepas is its bloodshot eyes.\n\nThe gaze of the catoblepas is equal to a <a href="/spells/death-spell-magic-user-lvl-6">death</a> ray, extending 6" from the eyes (even into the astral and ethereal planes). Any creature which meets this gaze dies without a chance to save itself. Complete surprise (a 2 on 6-sided die) means one of the party encountering the monster has met its gaze. Otherwise the very weak neck on the catoblepas has only a 25% chance of raising the head enough to use its eyes. If both parties are still this chance increases by 15% per melee round. If the monster must follow quick movements, or if it is shambling along in pursuit of prey, there is only a 10% chance per melee round of the neck raising the head sufficiently high to fix its gaze. A fleeing victim, even with eyes averted, is subject to the deadly effect of the catoblepas\' eyes, although there is a saving throw.'

        '<i>Description</i>: Of ruddy complexion, halflings tend toward brown or sandy brown hair coloration, and have brown or hazel eyes.

        '<b>Tallfellow</b>: A taller (4+\'), slimmer halfling, with fairer skin and hair. Tallfellows are very rare. They use more armor (AC 6), ride ponies and carry more spears. It is possible for exceptionally strong (17, 18) tallfellows to work to 5th or 6th level of fighting ability. They can speak <a href="/creatures/elf">elvish</a> and are very friendly with elves. They live for about 180 years on the average.\n\n'
        '<b>Stout</b>: This kind of halfling is a bit smaller (3½+\') and stockier than the typical (hairfeet). They use more armor also (AC 6), and employ morning stars in addition to the usual halflingish arms. Very strong stouts (18) are able to work up to 5th level fighting ability. Stouts have infravision and can detect sloping passageways. They have no fear of water and can swim. These halflings are able to speak <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarvish</a> and enjoy dwarven company. Stouts reach the age of 200 or more years.'

Unless slain on their own plane, invisible stalkers are simply sent back to the elemental plane when damage accrued exceeds their total hit points.\n\n'
        'The conjuring party retains full command of the invisible stalker summoned until it fulfills its duties or is killed. Once set upon a mission, an invisible stalker will follow through unceasingly until it is accomplished. They are faultless trackers within one day of a quarry\'s passing. They must be destroyed to make them cease an ordered attack. Once a mission is finished, the creature is freed to return to its own plane. The invisible stalker is at best an unwilling servant but will not resent a brief, uncomplicated task. Service involving a period of a week tries the creature severely, and anything longer is certain to make it attempt to fulfill the letter of command by perverting the spirit of it. This is not to say that impelling the invisible stalker to serve for extended periods is impossible, but the compulsion to cause it to do so fully and properly must be great, i.e. a carefully worded command from a very powerful magic-user. A simple command such as "Follow me, and guard me from any attack," could be interpreted to follow at 100\' distance if the invisible stalker had been on duty over a week - or perhaps even if it hadn\'t been that long, for dealing with such creatures is always a hazard. Similarly, a command to: "Keep me safe from all harm," can be construed by the invisible stalker that it is to carry the conjuring party to its own plane and place them in suspended animation in a secret room in its own abode, thus carrying out its duties to the letter.\n\n'
        'Each day of duty which an invisible stalker serves will see a 1% cumulative chance of the creature seeking to pervert the intent of its commands in order to be free of servitude. If no option remains open, the stalker must continue to serve.\n\n'

If a cleric is with the group in the lair, she will be of 5th to 8th level ability, and her lesser clerics will be 3rd or 4th level.\n\n'
        'There are always 2-8 <a href="/creatures/shark">sharks</a> with sahuagin in their lair. Sahuagin are able to make these monsters obey simple one or two word commands.\n\n'
        'Whenever a sahuagin lair is encountered there is a 5% chance that it will be the stronghold of a prince. The prince will have 8 hit dice +8 hit points, 9 guards of chieftain strength, and there will be 1 8th level sahuagin evil high priestess and 4 4th level underclerics. The number of males, females, hatchlings and eggs in a prince\'s lair is double the number rolled. There will be 4-24 sharks present at all times.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin lairs are actual villages or towns, constructed of stone. The buildings are domed, and the seaweed and similar marine plants growing around and on these buildings make them hard to detect.\n\n'
        'Although these creatures do not wear armor, their scaly hides are very tough and equal to armor class 5. Sahuagin wear a harness to carry their personal gear and weapons. A group of these creatures is typically armed as follows:\n'
        '30% spear & dagger\n'
        '50% trident, net & dagger\n'
        '20% heavy crossbow & dagger\n\n'
        'Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks which make escape from one virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by 3 javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30\' underwater, normally above water. Nets are used to entrap victims. Tridents have three uses: to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin are well-equipped to attack even without weapons, for they have long, sharp claws on their webbed hands which can inflict 1-2 hit points per attack, and they can use both simultaneously. Their powerful rear legs are likewise taloned, and if they kick an opponent with them they inflict 1-4 hit points damage with each hit from either foot. The sahuagin\'s mouth is filled with teeth and fangs, and if one successfully bites an opponent, from 1-4 points of damage will be inflicted. Thus it is possible for an unarmed sahuagin to attack 3 or 5 times in a melee round causing 1-2/1-2/1-4 and 1-4/1-4 if the legs can rake.\n\n'
        'The eyes and ears of these monsters are particularly keen. Sahuagin can see 30" underwater at 100\' depth. For each 100\' of greater depth, their vision is reduced 1", i.e. at 500 they can see 26", at 1,000 they can see 21". Their ears are so sharp as to be able to detect the clinking of metal at 1 mile, or a boat oar splashing at the same distance. However, at 24" or less their ears cannot detect the sounds of swimming or similar noise, although the sahuagin can still hear metallic or other clanks, clicks, thuds, etc.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin speak their own tongue, and some are evidently able to converse with the ixitxachitl in their own language.\n\n'
        '<i>Description</i>: A typical sahuagin is blackish green on the back shading to green on the belly. The fins are black. The great staring eyes are deep, shining black. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with 4 arms which are completely usable. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are light colored, but they darken and attain full growth approximately 1-2 months after hatching.\n\n'
        '<i>History and Legend</i>: The sahuagin are chronicled because of their evil, having time and again raided the land, desolating whole coasts, and, of course, destroying passing ships continually. The exact origin of the sahuagin is unknown. It is suggested that they were created from a nation of particularly evil humans by the most powerful of lawful evil gods in order to preserve them when the deluge came upon the earth. The <a href="/creatures/triton">tritons</a>, however, are purported to have stated that sahuagin are distantly related to the sea elves, claiming that the drow spawned the sahuagin.\n\n'
        'Few persons have survived capture by the sahuagin, for prisoners are usually imprisoned, tortured, and eaten. Creatures taken alive are brought to the sahuagins\' lair and confined in cells. Although the sahuagin are able to stay out of water for up to 4 hours, there is no air in the confinement areas in the typical village, but in towns of the nobles there are special quarters to maintain air-breathing creatures. The sahuagin will set aside a few prisoners to torture and provide sport - typically a fight to the death between two different creatures in an arena. The bulk of captives are simply killed and eaten. It is seldom that any prisoner escapes, although the sahuagin find sport in allowing captives to think they have found freedom, only to be encircled by sadistic guards while a school of sharks come for the kill.\n\n'
        'The sahuagin are cruel and brutal, the strongest always bullying the weaker. Any injured, disabled, or infirm specimen will be slain and eaten by these cannibalistic monsters. Even imperfect hatchlings are dealt with in this fashion. This strict law has developed a strong race, however, and any leader is always subject to challenge. Sahuagin never stop growing, although they grow slowly, and death comes to most before many years allow growth to large size. Leaders are the largest and strongest. It is reported that the 9 princes of the sahuagin are each of the 4-armed sort, as is the king. In any event, the loser of a challenge duel is always slain - in combat or afterwards. Duels are fought without weapons, only fang and claw being permitted.\n\n'
        'The king is supposed to inhabit a city somewhere at the greatest depth sahuagin can exist. This place is supposedly built in an undersea canyon, with palaces and dwellings built along either face. There, fully 5,000 of these monsters dwell, not counting the king\'s retinue of queens, concubines, nobles, guards, etc. said to number 1,000 or more. The king of the sahuagin is reported as huge of size (10 hit dice +10 hit points) and of greatest evil. He is always accompanied by 9 noble guards (6 hit dice +6) and the evil high priestess of all sahuagin, with her train of 9 under-clerics.'

The trapper then crushes them doing a base damage of 4 plus the armor class of the victim per turn of crushing. Those entrapped are unable to use weapons, for the great musculature of the trapper prevents it. Prey will be smothered in 6 melee rounds regardless of the damage sustained.

    description = ('The aarakocra are a race of intelligent avian humanoids. Their society consists of small tribes of about 11-30; each tribe has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles. The bird-men live on high peaks in the mountains, where they can soar all day on the winds and the thermals.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra have little to do with humankind beyond the occasional poaching of a farm animal (they appear incapable of distinguishing between domestic and wild animals, for this act is not one motivated by malice). They have even less to do with demi-humans and actively dislike humanoids. Infrequently, an aarakocra may agree to give information to, or act as a scout for, humans, in exchange for shiny coins or gems. As they are extremely reluctant to leave their familiar mountains such an act will only very rarely take place outside the bird-man\'s own territory.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra stand about 5\' high but they have a wing span of 20\'. Their wings/arms are built somewhat like those of a <a href="/creatures/pteranodon">pterodactyl</a>, with a hand half-way along each leading edge. The wing-section beyond the hand has as its leading edge an extremely lengthened and strengthened outer finger which locks in place during flight. The wing-hands cannot grasp while in flight, but when the bird-man is on the ground and the wings are folded back, the hands are nearly as useful as normal human hands. Each hand consists of three normal-sized fingers and an opposable thumb.\n\n'
        'The bird-man\'s might wing muscles are anchored in a bony keel which projects forward from the chest a full foot beyond the normal extent of a human chest. The legs are powerful, with "backward-bending" knees and dangerous-looking talons on the feet. The feet are actually more dangerous than they appear: the talons can unlock and fold back, uncovering a pair of fully-functional hands, each with three tough, powerful fingers and a thumb.\n\n'
        'It is these nether "hands" that the bird-man employs in aerial combat, either using the talons alone or clutching heavy fletched javelins, used for stabbing or throwing. Each feathered warrior usually carries half a dozen of these javelins, which do 2-8 hit points of damage each, strapped to its chest in individual sheaths. Aarakocra are remarkably adept at flinging these javelins while in the air, incurring none of the "to hit" penalties used in aerial missile fire.\n\n'
        'Their most devastating form of attack is to dive upon a victim with a javelin in each nether hand, building up great speed. The bird-man pulls out of the dive just as it reaches its target and snaps the javelins forward into its prey with great force and accuracy, meanwhile emitting a blood-curdling shriek. Such attacks are at +4 hit probability and do double damage if successful, but the aarakocra needs at least 200\' of dive to perform them properly.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra share with <a href="/creatures/eagle">eagles</a> the ability to plummet a great distance vertically downwards and pull out at the last moment. Rather than fling it away, a bird-man will save its last javelin for stabbing purposes in battle.\n\n'
        'The aarakocra are oviparous and the females tend the eggs during their 8-month incubation period. It is these temporarily nest-bound females which fabricate all the javelins, tools and other small items the tribe uses (the males do no work other than hunting). The females also weave the brilliant feathered banners and pennants which fly above the tribal nest and mark out their territory (each tribe has a unique, highly individual design). The sight of an aarakocra weaving is said to be impressive, as they do so while resting on their backs and using all four hands at the same time. Individually, their hands are not as dextrous as those of a human, but the extra pair more than compensates for this.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra speak their own language and that of the giant eagles, with which they are on mutually respectful terms. 10% of aarakocra also speak the common tongue. They get on very well with all forms of <a href="/creatures/air-elemental">air elemental</a>, and any five aarakocra can summon an air elemental by chanting and flying through an intricate aerial dance (this takes three melee rounds). The air elemental will comply with the bird-men\'s requests as a favor, but will not fight to the death on their behalf, returning to its own plane (if it can) before such an eventuality could occur. The bird-men are known to have tribal shamans.\n\n'
        'Color of plumage among the aarakocra varies from tribe to tribe, but the males are always crested and gaudier than the females. This is especially true during the once-yearly mating season when the plumage of the males shows up in particularly striking fashion. Their beaks are about 5" long, gray-black and in shape somewhat between that of a parrot and an eagle. The beak can deliver a nasty bite (1-3 hit points of damage) but is rarely used for fighting unless the bird-man is trapped on the ground. Their faces are in no way similar to human faces, though their eyes are set frontally on the head to provide binocular vision, and in fact their sight is so keen that they can distinguish detail at considerable distances. Though they are powerful, they are also light - an adult weight is typically in the range 50-80 pounds - and are unwilling to become involved in ground melee or fights which could result in grappling, since their hollow bones are quite fragile and could break if, for instance, a bird-man is thrown heavily to the ground. The aarakocra are extremely susceptible to claustrophobia. Such is their fear of being closed in that they will not even enter buildings, and only a mad or insanely desperate bird-man would venture below ground.\n\n'

The projection is physical in the sense that it can receive and inflict damage - in this respect it is a duplicate of the original. The berbalang can use all of the senses of the projection in its quest for food. The projection can range up to 3 miles from the material berbalang body.

Once such detail has been discerned, it will be clear to the observer that one of the "hands" of the female, held close to her side, carries a slim sword which blends into the rest of the stone so smoothly that it is near-invisible.\n\n'

This task will have been set by the creator who, if near at hand when the column animates, will be able to control it with simple verbal commands.

During this time the creeper has two main objectives. First, to destroy lanterns and tinderboxes, break flasks of oil and so on - any act which will inhibit the creation of illumination. Secondly, to steal any small magical items detected. Self-preservation ranks marginally above such objectives.\n\n'

    description = ('Ages past, when the <a href="/creatures/elf">elvenfolk</a> were but new to the face of the earth, their number was torn by discord and those of better disposition drove from them those of the elves who were selfish and cruel. However constant warfare between the two divisions of elvenkind continued, with the goodly ones ever victorious, until those of dark nature were forced to withdraw from the lands under the skies and seek safety in the realm of the underworld. Here, in lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages and caves hung with icicles of stone, the dark elvenfolk - the drow - found both refuge and comfort. Over the centuries they grew strong once again and schooled themselves in arcane arts. And though they were strong enough to face and perhaps defeat their former brethren in battle, the drow no longer desired to walk upon the green lands under the sun and stars. They no longer desired a life in the upper world, being content with the gloomy fairyland beneath the earth that they had made their own. Yet they neither forgave nor forgot, and even now, above all else, they bear enmity for all of their distant kin - elves and faeries - who drove them down beneath the earth and now dwell in the meadows and dells of the bright world. Though they are seldom if ever seen by any human or demi-human, the drow still persist, occasionally entering lower dungeon levels and consorting with other creatures in order to work out their schemes and inflict revenge upon those who inhabit the world above.\n\n'
        'Regardless of the number of drow appearing, there will always be one of higher level than the main body. Drow males are all at least 2nd level fighters - some are as high as 7th level in fighting ability. Males can also be magic-users, some as high as 12th level. Female drow are also at least 2nd level fighters and some have attained 9th level as fighters. Most drow clerics are female, and no upper limit to their level of ability is known; however no male drow cleric has been known to be higher than 4th level.\n\n'
        'Drow wear a fine mesh armor of exquisite workmanship. It is made of an alloy of steel containing adamantite. Even the lowliest fighters have in effect +1 chainmail, with higher level drow having +2, +3, +4 or even +5 chainmail. Small bucklers are also used - shields of unusual shape - those drow of greater experience level and importance in drow society having bucklers fashioned of adamantite so as to be +1, +2, or even +3 value.\n\n'
        'As will be described later, all drow move silently and with graceful speed, even when wearing their black mesh of armor. Each drow carries a small amount of personal wealth in a soft leather bag worn around the neck beneath the mail. In addition they arm themselves with long dagger and short sword of adamantite alloy (+1 to as high as +3 or even +4 borne by noblefolk); 50% or more carry small crossbows which are held in one hand (6" range light crossbow) and shoot darts coated with a poison which renders the victim unconscious (save is at -4). These darts also inflict 1-3 points of damage on a victim. A few drow also carry adamantite maces (+1 to +5) and/or small javelins (also poisoned with the same substance as the darts) with atlatls (9" range, +3/+2/+1 to hit at short/medium/long range).\n\n'
        'Drow have superior infravision of the 12" range variety and move with silence. The black boots and cloaks that Drow wear are similar to <i>cloaks</i> and <i>boots of elvenkind</i>, except that the wearer has only a 75% chance of surprising enemies or blending into shadows. The material will not cut easily and cloaks have a +6 to saving throws vs. fire attacks; however, any alteration to the cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material and making it useless. Drow themselves are only 12½% (1 in 8) likely to be surprised by opponents. Drow are also both intelligent and highly co-ordinated, being able to use either or both hands/arms for attack and defense. They make saving throws versus all forms of magic (clerical included) spells, whether from a caster or from a device, at +2. Drow magic resistance increases by 2% for each level of experience they have gained, with multi-classed individuals gaining this bonus for but one of their classes (the highest). Thus, a 7th level Drow is 64% resistant to any magic and will save at +2 against any magic which could have an effect.\n\n'

If they are attacking targets inside the radius of <i>light</i> or <i>continual light</i> spells, the bright illumination causes them to suffer a "to hit" penalty of -1 and the converse +1 on saving throws against such attacks is awarded to the target creatures. If bright light exists, it is 75% likely that drow will retire from the situation because of the illumination, unless such a retreat would imperil one of their number, would otherwise be harmful to their desired ends or would expose some important feature to the light-bringing intruders. In any event, such dimmer light sources as torches, lanterns, magic weapons, <a href="/creatures/giant-fire-beetle">fire beetle</a> essence or <spells/faerie-fire-druid-lvl-1"><i>faerie fire</i></a> do not adversely affect the performance of the dark elves.\n\n'

All of the dark elves also have a <i>silent language</i> composed of hand movements, and this means of communication is highly sophisticated, being able to convey much information to a considerable degree of complexity. When drow are within 30\' of each other, they use facial and body expression, movement and posture; these latter means of communication alone are capable of conveying considerable information, and when coupled with hand/finger movements the whole is as erudite as any spoken speech.\n\n'

When these are exposed to direct sunlight, irreversible decay starts and the items will become totally useless in 2-12 days. If protected from sunlight, they will retain their special properties for 31-50 days before becoming normal items; and if exposed to the radiations of the Drow homeland for a period of 1 week out of every 4 weeks, the items could remain potent indefinitely.

Githzerai appear not to have developed the <i>special silver swords</i> as have the githyanki.

        'Whereas the githyanki are users of baroque armor and ornate weapons and are generally florid in their magic-use, githzerai are monastic creatures, their weapons are very plain and their magic-use economic of movement and direct in effect.\n\n'

The chance of a character with monkish abilities is only 5%, but if one is encountered it will be of 6th-8th experience level since the monks\' main training takes place in the githzerai fortresses.\n\n'

If the master encounters the creature again he may acquire its services in the same manner as before.\n\n'

If the jermlaine are in their lair, it is 50% probable that there will be connecting rat tunnels). This cohabitation extends to all forms of mutual co-operation and defense.\n\n'

Note that beating with the clubs has a 2% cumulative chance per blow of knocking the victim unconscious, but those protected by splint, banded or plate mail will not be so attacked. Well-armored victims who cannot be bound fast are attacked to kill - possibly with flaming oil missiles or acid. Some victims will be devoured by the jermlaine (or their rat-friends) but most humans will be stripped naked, shaved and left trussed and helpless in the passageway.

Their vandalism will usually be noticed only 1-12 turns later, when a weakened strap parts, a seam opens fully etc. Worse still, if packs and other goods are placed out where jinxkins can reach them, these monstrous atomites will pollute the water, sour the wine and turn it into vinegar, spoil food, desecrate holy water, steal small items (gems, coins, garlic buds, herbs, etc.) wedge daggers or swords so that they are difficult to draw out quickly, cut bow strings, blunt arrows, puncture oil flasks and so on.\n\n'

They "swim" along the layers of rock in small schools, riding on earth movements and the shifting of geological strata as if swimming - or surfing - in the sea. When they find a suitable vein of ore, they settle down to feed and ingest the material, grinding it up and, through their curious metabolic and digestive processes, actually separating out and refining the metal. The slaggy waste material is excreted and the metal is deposited in the khargra\'s internal reservoirs, there to be assimilated slowly into the body.\n\n'
        'Naturally a khargra prefers refined metal to unrefined ore, and if the former is sensed reasonably close to hand, it will forego its normal diet for this new rich source of food. Khargra consider armor and weaponry a tasty meal indeed and are particularly fond of "eating" metallic treasure.\n\n'
        'Khargra will leap from the wall or floor of a cavern or subterranean passage like fish leaping from water, flying as far as 10\'.

When attacked with a metal weapon, a khargra will bite the end off and swallow it on any roll of 16 or better. They fight non-metallic opponents by delivering a powerful bite for 3-18 hit points of damage, but their attack will be merely incidental to their main objective of eating metal. They use their three strong clawed arms to grasp and pull themselves towards their prey, and at least one of the three arms must "hit" a victim before a successful bite can be inflicted on him, though the arms themselves do no damage. Once an arm has grasped, however, it will not let go until the way is clear for it to reach the metal it desires or its victim has been killed. Khargra have been known to bite right through large flesh creatures in order to reach a concentration of metal beyond. Each arm "hits" as if a creature of 12HD.\n\n'

        'Meazels rarely venture far from their lairs and take all corpses there to be eaten in safety. Piles of sacks full of bones are often to be found near a meazel lair (any gems the creature has found in treasure will be in these sacks, since it does not recognize the value of precious and semi-precious stones). For the same reason, there will be no gems in the lair.\n\n'
        'Most creatures of the underworld will attack meazels, for they have a nasty reputation even among dungeon denizens.\n\n'
        'In combat they attack with their two claws, each inflicting 1-4 hit points of damage. Alternatively, they use a piece of tough, thin cord to strangle their victims; a "hit indicates that the cord has been wrapped round the victim\'s neck and he will die from strangulation within two melee rounds unless he breaks free, or the meazel dies or is forced to release its hold (for example to defend against attack from another quarter). However the creature can only execute this kind of attack against a victim which is man-sized or smaller and only if it can approach the victim from the rear undetected, achieving surprise.\n\n'
        '<i>Description</i>: The meazel has skin which varies from light gray to dark green; irregular patches of an angry red color will occur on most (85%) of individuals due to a skin disease - neither harmful to the creature beyond its disfiguring effect, nor contagious - prevalent in the species, these patches giving the meazel almost a leprous appearance. The eyes are jet black and the feet partially webbed.'

In total they present a horrid appearance and will cause <i>fear</i> in any person with four or fewer hit dice who sees them, this causing the victim to fall inert to the ground for 5-8 melee rounds (the number of rounds is halved if the victim makes his saving throw).\n\n'
        'The meenlocks have their lair in dark, sealed, vertical shafts underground. If the seal is removed, the bottom of the shaft cannot be seen and anything dropped in will land noiselessly on a thick moss "carpet" which lines the walls and floor of the shaft. The shaft will be dark and a smell of rotting corpses will drift upwards. Characters other than the most insensitive will also detect a strong emanation of evil even without the use of a <a href="/spells/detect-evil-cleric-lvl-1"><i>detect evil</i></a> spell. After descending vertically for 20\' or so, the shaft twists and curves, so it is impossible to see the bottom even with a <a href="/spells/light-cleric-lvl-1"><i>light</i></a> spell, which will only reveal detail of the upper parts.\n\n'
        'If brave adventurers penetrate the shaft they will eventually find the meenlock lair - a large space like a small cave at the very foot of the shaft. The creatures will always attack (exception - bright light will cause them to flee if they are able) and will use their two claws, each of which inflicts 1-4 hit points of damage. The touch of the meenlock causes <i>paralyzation</i> (saving throw applicable). At close quarters such as in their lair, however, the meenlocks\' telepathic powers are virtually useless - this is their reason for the artificial smell of rotting corpses which they deliberately create in order to deter entrance to the lair.\n\n'
        'The creatures will use considerable ingenuity to extinguish sources of light - torches, lanterns and so forth. They have a limited <a href="/spells/dimension-door-magic-user-lvl-4"><i>dimension door</i></a> ability over a distance of 6\' every other melee round - when using this ability, attacks on them are at -4 on the "to hit" roll. However they cannot use this power when carrying a victim - three meenlocks are required for such a task.\n\n'
        'It is if adventurers remove the seal from the top of the shaft but subsequently fail to penetrate the meenlocks\' lair that the creatures will take fullest advantage. When the adventurers depart, they will be followed at a safe distance by the nasty little beasts, which can climb quickly and noiselessly up the shaft by using the deadening qualities of the moss carpet. One of the adventurers will be "marked" by the meenlocks - selected at random, though if a paladin is present he will be given priority - and the meenlocks will concentrate their subsequent attacks on him alone, being highly evil and greatly desirous of wreaking vengeance on humankind. The victim selected will always be human if one is present, but if not the creatures will choose an <a href="/creatures/elf">elf</a>, <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarf</a> or any other near-human.\n\n'
        'From the time of his "marking" onwards, the chosen victim will receive disturbing telepathic messages; the meenlocks can communicate telepathically over a 300\' range. The messages will vary in content but the threat will be the same - that the meenlocks are pursuing the victim relentlessly and intend to make him one of them. The victim will also be conscious of stealthy movement in the shadows and of rustling, scratching noises (these will also be illusory and induced telepathically). Companions of the victim will hear and detect nothing and may conclude that their colleague is mentally aberrant.\n\n'
        'The meenlocks will not attack until the party beds down to rest. However, until that time the victim will become increasingly preoccupied with his predicament and will be able to concentrate less and less upon his adventure. His efficiency will thus be reduced, though the extent and effect of this will vary and is to be determined by the referee. As a guide, for every hour the victim is harassed by meenlocks, his strength, dexterity, intelligence and wisdom will be reduced temporarily by 1 point each, in addition he will attack at -1 on the "to hit" roll in melee and (if he is a spell-caster) victims of his spells will receive a +2 bonus on their saving throw. All these effects are cumulative but will disappear as soon as the meenlock threat has somehow been averted (if for example the party moves into an area which is brightly illuminated and which the meenlocks will not be able to enter).\n\n'
        'When the party including the victim has bedded down to rest, the meenlocks will attack, moving very silently (80% chance of obtaining surprise even against a watchful guard - 100% against a sleeper). They will attempt to silence any guards and drag their victim away (they will not attack the victim with their claws unless absolutely necessary, but they show no similar mercy to others). If they succeed in doing so, they will take the victim to their shaft, sealing it after entry. After a short but gruesome treatment, the victim himself becomes a meenlock.'

    description = ('This creature looks exactly like a normal <a href="/creatures/goblin">goblin</a> and has all characteristics of that race with one important exception - it suffers from a curious spatio-temporal reversal. It remains a mystery why only goblins are susceptible to this strange disorder. Nilbogism (the name given to the disorder) appears to occur when overly heavy use of magic strains the fabric of the space-time continuum, and leads to some very strange localized events. The coincidence of conditions which lead to nilbogism is extremely rare and is only imperfectly understood. Although the creature itself does not in any sense transmit the disorder to those around it, some of the effects are transmitted.\n\n'
        'Many and varied accounts have been received about the nature of the space-time disturbances which take place in the presence of nilbogs. Only one factor appears to be common - the adventurers will have no control over their own actions and will generally pursue courses of action contrary to their normal intent; for example they may feel an overwhelming compulsion to load all their treasure into an empty treasure chest in the nilbog lair and leave empty-handed. There are no saving throws against these effects, nor is there any known defense (though a powerful spell such as a <a href="/spells/wish-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>wish</i></a>, will, if used properly, have a good chance of rendering local immunity against the effects).\n\n'
        'Another curious feature of nilbog power is that the creature gains hit points when it is struck, the addition being equal to the intended damage rolled. It can only lose hit points by such means as casting <i>cure wounds</i> spells on it, forcibly feeding it <i>healing</i> potions and so on.\n\n'
        'For obvious reasons, encounters with these strange creatures are dreaded and, as a result, normal goblins tend to be treated with extreme caution lest they turn out to be nilbogs. There appears to be no way of distinguishing between the two apart from use of such spells as <a href="/spells/commune-cleric-lvl-5"><i>commune</i></a> or by trial and error.\n\n'

This transformation takes place in one segment of time and appears to be instinctive, requiring no concentration on the part of the "parent" beast. The creature will always attack a party of adventurers or any other monster it encounters, usually (90%) transforming itself as soon as its enemies are sighted and then attempting to surround the party, all nine "children" acting in co-operative fashion as though there exists some telepathic bonds between them which gives them the effective power of a corporate brain.

Once one round of <i>regeneration</i> has taken place, the parent will again dissociate into nine (or perhaps fewer, if one has been killed) offspring; again the parent can partake in combat during the melee round of dissociation.

If an attempt is made to <i>raise</i> her during that three-day period, her chances of surviving the <i>system shock</i> are half normal, and failure of that attempt means that no further attempt can possibly succeed - the process by which she becomes a penanggalan is then inexorable.\n\n'
        'If an attempt to <a href="/spells/raise-dead-cleric-lvl-5"><i>raise</i></a> any victim succeeds, however, the victim will return to normal (all hit points restored, strength and constitution back to normal) after two months of rest and recuperation; furthermore that victim will be immune to further attacks by a penanggalan and will recognize one for what it is.\n\n'
        'After the penanggalan head and gut have left the body in the lair, the internal organs swell up, whether feeding takes place or not, and cannot return to the abdomen until they have been soaked in vinegar for an hour, during which time they return to normal size. For this reason, the creature will always keep a large vessel filled with vinegar concealed in each of its lairs, and a penanggalan lair may often be detected by the distinctive odor of vinegar which permeates it.\n\n'

This weird sound is like a gentle wind blowing through trees; it can be heard up to ¼ of a mile away in still air through unobstructed airways, and one closed door in the path will not attenuate the sound sufficiently to render it inaudible at such distances. Underground, the sound reverberates around corridors and rooms, making location of its source difficult.\n\n'
        'The dronesong has a curious effect on undead creatures, causing them to feel "at peace" and to be rendered inert - an effect known as the "sleep of the dead". Any number may be slept by these means, but otherwise the dronesong acts as though it were an attempt by a second level cleric to turn away undead (so <a href="/creatures/skeleton">skeletons</a> are affected on a roll of 7-20, <a href="/creatures/zombie">zombies</a> on a roll of 10-20, <a href="/creatures/ghoul">ghouls</a> on a roll of 13-20, <a href="/creatures/shadow">shadows</a> on a roll of 16-20, <a href="/creatures/wight">wights</a> on a roll of 19-20, <a href="/creatures/ghast">ghasts</a> on a roll of 20 and <a href="/creatures/wraith">wraiths</a> and more powerful undead are not affected). While "asleep" the undead cannot be turned or destroyed, but if they are attacked physically they will awaken to defend themselves.\n\n'
        'It windy locations it will often be immobile, taking in the air, and in such conditions it is 10% easier to surprise than normal (15% instead of the normal 5%). It is fast-moving, aggressive and dangerous when encountered, fighting with the claws on its two "forepaws", each of which can inflict 1-8 hit points of damage. Additionally, if either claw hits on a roll of 18 or more (or a 20 in any event) the victim is crushed onto the exoskeletal spikes and suffers an additional 3-24 hit points of damage from this "hug".\n\n'
        'The sussurus loathes fire and will immediately attack anyone carrying a torch or a lantern in an attempt to destroy the oxygen-consuming flames.\n\n'
        'The sussurus is believed to have a lifespan of over 1,000 years. Though it has no language as such, a sussurus communicates with others of its kind by slight and subtle variation in the dronesong; however it is only very rarely that two sussuri are close enough together to communicate in this way.'

Each individual also carries a pouch of special darts, 7-10 hand-hurled missiles of about nine inches in length, with a 40\' range and which inflicts 1-3 hit points of damage. When one of these darts strikes it is constructed so as to compact and break a small glass bead containing a gas. Any creature struck on its front parts must save against poison; if it fails, the puff of gas has reached the creature\'s system and the creature will be <i>stunned</i> on the next round and <a href="/spells/slow-magic-user-lvl-3"><i>slowed</i></a> for the four rounds following that. Deep gnomes above 3rd leve also carry 3-6 darts which contain an acid which eats a three-inch hole in armor protection in 1 round, or inflicts an additional 2-8 hit points of damage on non-protected targets (such as armor with holes, ring mail, chain mail etc.) A svirfneblin can hurl two darts in a single melee round.\n\n'

They are 60% likely to be unseen by any observer, even a <a href="/creatures/kuo-toa">kuo-toan</a>, as deep gnomes are able to "freeze" in place for long periods without any hint of movement. They are surprised only 1 in 12 due to their keen hearing and smelling abilities. They are likely to surprise opponents 90% of the time.\n\n'
        'All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra 5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. No illusion, phantasm, or hallucination is able to affect a sverfneblin\'s mind. Because of this and their high widom, speed and agility, they make all saving throws at +3 except against poison when their bonus is +2.\n\n'

All these small creatures can converse with speaking creatures from the <i>Elemental Plane of Earth</i> and it is 90% unlikely that any such creature will harm a svirfneblin, though the deep gnome might have to pay a heavy bribe in precious metal and gems so to escape.\n\n'

        'When being pursued by enemies, the svirfnebli will typically dash into a secret escape passage tunnelled to their size. Larger escape routes used by the deep gnomes will be filled with covered pit traps and rock deadfalls. A gnome leader is 75% likely to carry 3-12 small rock-like containers, and these will be strewn in the path of pursuing foes if no handy escape route is nearby. These crystals are crushed when stepped on by any creature weighing more than 100 pounds, and each releases a cloud of poison gas of about 10\' diameter and 15\' height. Any creature passing through such a gas cloud must save versus poison or lose consciousness for 1-12 turns. The gas cloud dissipates in 2 rounds.\n\n'
        'Deep gnomes will usually aid any non-enemy for a fee, and they will certainly help in fighting drow, kuo-toans or mind flayers, providing there is a reasonable chance of defeating these mortal enemies. They love gems and will take great risks in order to gain them.\n\n'

If unarmed, they fight with four claws for 1-4 hit points of damage each.

They may transfer from the <i>Ethereal</i> to the <i>Prime Material Plane</i> in one segment (6 seconds), but the reverse process takes two melee rounds. A xill will usually initiate an attack by emerging suddenly from the <i>Ethereal Plane</i> near to a chosen victim, achieving surprise 90% of the time. In attacking, it will use two of its arms in an attempt to grapple its victim, while using the other two (which might carry weapons) to subdue. The subduing attacks are resolved in the same way as attacks to subdue a dragon. Upon announcement of intent to <i>strike to subdue</i>, all hit points of damage scored by attacks on the victim (from the two subduing arms) are considered non-fatal battering/bruising damage.

        'The grappling attacks are normal; both grappling arms must score a hit for the grapple to be successful, otherwise it is assumed that the victim has been able to avoid being grappled. However if the victim has previously been subdued, the grappling attack will always succeed in the next melee round. If the xill succeeds in grappling a victim, it will then inject a paralyzing fluid into his bloodstream through its claws, (normal saving throw applicable) in the next melee round. Victims grappled thus have one melee round to break free before the fluid is injected, and they may attempt to do so by "saving against strength" - a d20 is rolled, and if the result is lower than the victim\'s strength, he has escaped from the clutches of the xill.\n\n'
        'In summary, the xill attempts to grapple and paralyze the victim, or to subdue and grapple him. Once either of these results has been achieved, it will attempt to become <i>Ethereal</i> (and its power to do so will extend to its paralyzed/subdued victim) and carry the victim to its lair on the <i>Ethereal Plane</i> to inject the eggs. During this two-melee-round transitory period when the xill and its victim are turning <i>ethereal</i>, the xill cannot move, it is vulnerable to magic (i.e. its magic resistance is reduced to zero) and can be hit by weapons at -3 hit probability. When the transition is complete, however, the creature can only be attacked ethereally and its normal magic resistance is restored.\n\n'

As it takes some 5-8 rounds for the circling afanc to create the whirlpool, and because the monster must be at the surface to do so, concerted attack by spells and/or heavy missile fire might drive the creature off.

They are fanatically loyal to a single cow and will defend her to the death. They are immune to electrical and cold attacks and will only take half-damage from fire-based attacks.\n\n'

At times, however, a barghest will spawn, and its litter of 6 will be sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow. Those which survive will eventually return to Gehenna, but while they are yet young they must feed upon the lives of men.

While goblins recognize and worship barghests, other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these goblins. Their goblin hosts fear and serve barghests, going to great lengths to bring them human sacrifices. The barghests, in turn, slay the powerful enemies of the goblins and generally enrich the treasure possessed by their hosts.\n\n'

(Zero level humans gain barghests only one-half an energy level, so they are less desirable prey than are exceptional persons.) Likewise, as hit dice are gained, the barghest also becomes more powerful. Its armor class increases by 1 place with each additional hit die, and its strength grows from an initial 18/00 to 24; damage increases accordingly, as does magic resistance and intelligence. When a barghest eventually attains full growth and power, it is able to shift itself to the Planes of Gehenna, where it will search out its own reeking valley rift.\n\n'

Its adult skin color is blue. The eyes of the barghest are glowing orange when it is excited, but otherwise they are indistinguishable from those of a goblin. Their canine forms can be those of any typical large dogs, and in these forms it is almost (95%) impossible to tell them from normal dogs, except that other dogs will fear and hate them, attacking at every opportunity.'

    description = ('<b>Barkburrs</b>: Barkburrs are a form of animated plant that arise spontaneously within a wood or forest in order to defend it. They are anatomically similar to limpets, having a very hard, woody carapace (armor class 0) which shields a soft woody interior (armor class 8).\n\n'
        'They will always be encountered in their lair, which will consist of 1 or more oddly shaped trees (the metamorphosed remains of past victims; see below). The barkburrs attach themselves to a tree where they are very hard to distinguish from ordinary burrs. Only druids and rangers have any chance of recognizing a barkburr for what it is (4% chance plus 1% per level). Such lairs will normally be on paths through a wood where travellers are likely to pass.\n\n'
        'Barkburrs are extremely sensitive to actions which conflict with the interests of the forest they live in and are capable of detecting such an act (basically anything which a druid would find abhorrent) occuring within a radius of 1 mile. They will attack any humanoid creature coming within 20 feet if it has performed such an act within a radius of 1 mile and/or if its alignment includes an evil component.\n\n'
        'A barkburr attacks by leaping suddenly from the supporting tree towards its intended victim who may be up to 20 feet away. Because of its camouflage it will always gain surprise unless recognized. It will attempt to attach its soft underside to the victim\'s body and then insert a sharp, barbed tube (inflicting 1 point of damage). For determining the success or failure of this whole attack routine (which takes but a single round) it should be treated as a single attack by a 6 hit dice monster.\n\n'
        'If the attack fails, the barkburr falls to the ground where it is practically helpless (see below). If the attack succeeds, in the next round the barkburr will begin to inject a lignifying poison into the victim. This injection will continue for up to 2 rounds plus 1 round for each of the barkburr\'s hit dice. Each round the victim must save vs. poison or lignification will set in. Lignification involves a rapid transformation of the victim into a small tree: feet become roots, body and legs the trunk, and head and arms branches. The transformation takes 1 turn, and once started it will not cease even if the barkburr is killed and/or removed. Most of the victim\'s equipment close to his body (clothes, armor, etc.) is enclosed by bark, but some (e.g., a sword, a shield or a ring) may remain hanging from a branch or be caught in the roots. Of the gear which is enclosed, all but magical items, gold, silver, platinum, and gems will be absorbed into the wood of the tree over a period of 2-7 hours.\n\n'
        'A barkburr may be removed from its victim (before or after lignification has set in) by killing it, applying fire, or by force. Attacks on the barkburr are made against its armor class 0 carapace, and attacks which miss should be rolled again against the victim\'s armor class. The application of fire has a 15% cumulative chance per round of dislodging the barkburr, which takes only 1 point of fire damage per round from fire applied to the outer carapace, but the victim will take fire damage unless protected. It is not possible to remove a barkburr by pulling it directly away from the victim, but pulling or pushing it sideways will succeed if a roll of 5d10 is less than the total strength being applied. This latter method will inflict 1-10 points of damage on the character, if successful, as the barbed poison needle is torn out. A maximum of 3 people, including the victim, can act together to attempt to remove a barkburr in this way.\n\n'
        'On the ground a barkburr is almost helpless; unable to leap from this position, it can crawl at 1/2" and is easily flipped over to reveal its armor class 8 underside. Fire applied to the underside inflicts normal damage.\n\n'
        'Since they have no minds as such, barkburrs are immune to spells such as <a href="/spells/charm-monster-magic-user-lvl-4"><i>charm monster</i></a> or <a href="/spells/sleep-magic-user-lvl-1"><i>sleep</i></a>.\n\n'
        'Once lignification has set in the barkburr will cease injecting poison and use the victim as a platform from which to launch an attack on any other eligible victim within 20 feet. Note, however, that a barkburr is only capable of injecting poison for a total of 2 rounds plus 1 round per hit die each day. Note also that the poison is only effective if injected by a barkburr.\n\n'
        'Once lignified, a creature begins a further transformation into a form which is safe from the point of view of the wood. This process takes as many days as the victim has level or hit dice, and during this time the victim remains helpless in tree form (having armor class 10 and its original number of hit points). At the end of the period the victim either remains fixed in its tree form or undergoes a rapid metamorphosis into a woodland creature or a druid. The final form adopted is determined by rolling a percentile die and consulting the following table:\n\n'

        'A creature who adopts any final form other than that of the druid will have no desire to leave the wood and will resist attempts to make him do so.\n\n'
        'Only a full <a href="/spells/wish-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>wish</i></a> will restore a creature to its original form once the transformation is completed.

        '<b>Direburrs</b>: Unwholesome woods and forests will produce direburrs that will attack any humanoid coming within 20 feet regardless of his past actions or alignment.

Once airborne, however, their sonics allow them to fly through narrow places, even in total darkness. Their flight being rapid and fairly silent, they surprise prey 50% of the time.

Its body is bat-like, about 2 feet long, with a wingspan approaching 4 feet; its entire body is flaming, and it radiates a temperature of several hundred degrees. Its mouth is small but the fangs therein are razor-sharp, and the damage from burning affects the victim more than the blood drain (hence 2-8 points of damage per round). The skin of the fire bat is tough and leathery, and even the relatively thin wings are difficult to pierce.\n\n'

How they travel to the Prime Material Plane is a mystery, but some sages have speculated that when <a href="/creatures/fire-elemental">fire elementals</a> are summoned, once in a great while some fire bats will appear with them; and woe to the conjurer, for the fire bats are not under the mage\'s control at all! Fire bats reproduce by fission after gorging themselves on blood, so even 1 fire bat escaping into this plane can start a colony and can replace any casualties. A fire bat colony will not grow very large, however, for they will instinctively limit they population to the available food supply.\n\n'
        'When fire bats engage an opponent, they make swooping attacks as they attempt to attach themselves to the victim. Once they have attached themselves, fire bats do not need to roll for further attacks and will automatically burn and bleed their victims for a total of 3 rounds (the first round they scored a hit plus 2 more rounds). At the end of 3 rounds, the satiated fire bat will drop off and return to its lair. If the victim dies before 3 rounds are over, the unsatiated fire bats will attack other opponents to finish feeding (but will never drain more than 3 rounds\' worth of blood whether from 1, 2, or 3 victims). Fire bats can detect invisible opponents because of an advanced sonar sense and infravision; they attack invisible targets without penalty. Unlike ordinary <a href="/creatures/bat">bats</a>, fire bats are not harmed by sunlight (or other bright lights) and can see within the normal vision range quite well.

If the number of fire bats ever falls below 25% of their starting force (whether from casualties or satisfied returnees), the fire bats will all instantly withdraw and attempt to escape to their lair. If cornered in their lair, they will fight ferociously to the death. When they die, a burst of flame envelopes them and their physical bodies are transported back to the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they are reborn.\n\n'
        'The lair of a fire bat colony tends to be rocky and cavelike, with many exits and labyrinthine passages but only one large, easily noticeable entrance. Treasure is likely to be in the form of gems and jewelry. because fire bats love sparkling stones and especially prize rubies, jacinths, and carnelians. One or 2 young fire bats (under 1 year old) may be found in the lair if a hunting pack is destroyed, and each young fire bat will have one-half the hit dice and damage per attack of an adult.\n\n'
        'Fire bats move by an awkward hop-walk on the ground or (more effeciently) by flight. Fire bats use true flight and not gliding, because hot internal gases lighten them a great deal. Water scares fire bats, but it takes a minimum of 10 gallons of cool water to douse 1 fire bat\'s external fires. Once extinguished, it requires 10 rounds of drying off before the fire bat can ignite again. During this period it cannot fly, and will only do 1-4 points of damage if it attacks successfully. Fire bats can glide through hot solutions (including lava and magma) at their flying speed, for they are at home in anything involving fire.'

The character\'s body will collapse and moulder in a single round and be totally gone. No saving throw is possible; the attack is irresistible. An <i>amulet of life protection</i> will prevail over the lifestealing powers of a gem, but the character\'s body will perish nonetheless. The skull will then sink down again, sated. If it is struck or touched a 2nd time, it will again rise and howl and then drain the soul of the next strongest character into another gem. This process recurs as long as the skull is intact and continues to be molested. If all jewels are filled, then only the killing howl will be possible thereafter, but the monster can also pronounce a curse upon the remaining antagonists. Such curses are very powerful and may include: always to be hit by any opponent attacking; never to make a saving throw; or always to lose all treasure without gaining any experience from it. The curse can be removed by a <a href="/spells/remove-curse-cleric-lvl-3"><i>remove curse</i></a> spell, but the charisma of the character so treated will drop permanently by 1 point. (Magical increase of charisma remains possible of course.)\n\n'

If the skull is destroyed, a saving throw vs. spell must be made for any gem <i>trapping a soul</i> as if the character trapped within it was doing so. Those gems for which saving throws failed contain no life-force; the demilich has drained the souls and devoured them before being destroyed.

Each spell-like power is usable 1 per round, 1 at a time, at will. Shadows and darkness cast persist as long as the demon desires or until otherwise dispelled. Nabassu have thief-like abilities to move silently, hide in shadows, hear noise, and strike from behind. The level of their performance is equal to one-half of their hit point bonus, measured as if it were thief level. Nabassu can be harmed only by iron or +1 or better magic weapons. They have the ability to change their coloration from brown-black to pale dove gray, with all shades in between possible. This allows them to hide in shadows or against the right background coloration. They have an effective strength of 18/00.\n\n'

    description = ('Pazuzu, or Pazzuzeus, is unlike all other lords of the Abyssal Planes in that he rules the skies above all of the layers, at least to some extent. He differs in several other ways as well. Pazuzu does not compete for rulership on any plane or in any place, for he considers himself above competition. Instead, he treats all those with power on the lower planes equally (if not actually regarding them as equals). Pazuzu can travel freely in the whole of the Lower Outer Planes and is known to be on amicable terms with mighty daemons and the dukes of Hell. Pazuzu is also able to enter the Prime Material Plane at will. Whether he does this by means of his own power or some secret artifact is under question. Pazuzu is lord of all evil flying creatures, and those of under 5 hit dice will obey his every command if he is within sight of them.\n\n'
        'The main efforts of Pazuzu are devoted to the Prime Material Plane. There he uses his powers to gain followers and servants. His especial joy is to turn lawful good clerics and paladins from their alignment to his own service. This he accomplishes by first causing them to speak his name aloud 3 times in succession. The alignment change does not occur yet, but the summons brings Pazuzu to the person speaking. Pazuzu then explains that the summoner may call upon him for aid at any time. Pazuzu may in turn ask a service immediately or demand it after his aid has been given. Compliance with any request or demand of Pazuzu will then change the alignment of the servitor. All such actions tend to bring chaos but not always direct evil. Although chaotic, Pazuzu will help those obeying and serving him if it suits his purpose or amuses him at the time. Of course, the more frequently service is rendered, the greater the evil, and the more evil the servants become.\n\n'
        'It is said that Pazuzu has a great sense of humor, and at times he has not taken umbrage at a check or defeat dealt to him, particularly if the opponents were clever and intelligent and managed to outwit him. In addition to the powers typical of all demons, Pazuzu has the following spell-like abilities which he is able to employ at will, 1 at a time, 1 per round: <a href="/spells/astral-spell-cleric-lvl-7"><i>astral travel</i></a>, <a href="/spells/call-lightning-druid-lvl-3"><i>call lightning</i></a>, <a href="/spells/control-weather-cleric-lvl-7"><i>control weather</i></a>, <a href="/spells/darkness-15-radius-magic-user-lvl-2"><i>darkness</i></a> (within a 20-foot radius), <a href="/spells/stone-to-flesh-magic-user-lvl-6"><i>flesh to stone</i></a>, <a href="/spells/shape-change-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>shape change</i></a>, <a href="/spells/statue-magic-user-lvl-7"><i>statue</i></a>, <a href="/spells/symbol-magic-user-lvl-8"><i>symbol</i></a> (1 each of pain, hopelessness, death), <a href="/spells/tongues-cleric-lvl-4"><i>tongues</i></a>, <a href="/spells/holy-unholy-word-cleric-lvl-7"><i>unholy word</i></a>, <a href="/spells/wind-walk-cleric-lvl-7"><i>wind walk</i></a>, <a href="/spells/wish-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>wish</i></a> once per day.

No diakk desires to be slain, regardless if it is eaten or not (as they often are by hordlings and other creatures found on the planes). Even other flocks are distrusted, because of the strong rule.

Feather color is in sickening hues and combinations and varies wildly, including pea green and rusty-red orange, purple and orange and pink, and dirty yellow.

In cases where 2 are found, they will be a mated pair of adults (1d4 +4 for age category determination). Cloud dragons are sky-dwelling creatures. While some live in caves which are shrouded by clouds, most (75%) dwell on cloud islands and lair there (cf. <a href="/creatures/cloud-giant">Cloud Giant</a>). They dislike intrusion and will either avoid contact with or attack unwanted visitors.\n\n'
        'It is 75% unlikely that a cloud dragon can be distinguished from a normal cloud, as all of these creatures can assume a cohesive gaseous form at will. Not only is recognition difficult, but gaseous armor class is -3. However, their only attacks while in cloud form are spells. In order to physically attack, the dragons must assume solid form (armor class 0). Similarly, solid form negates innate magic resistance. Attack routine consists of a claw/claw/bite/tail-lash sequence. The latter mode of attack is useful only if 1 or more opponents are at the rear of the cloud dragon\'s position. Three times per day a cloud dragon can exhale a blast of air. This airblast is 3" wide, 3" deep, and from 12-14" long (according to the number of hit dice of the dragon). All creatures caught within it will be blown around if they weigh less than 10 pounds times the hit points of the cloud dragon. For example, an ancient cloud dragon of huge size could blow an airblast which would affect all creatures weighing 1120 pounds or less. Tumbling and wind damage is 1 point per hit point of the dragon. Creatures not blown around take half normal damage, this from wind and wind-borne particles. All paper and similarly flimsy objects will be blown away or shredded if held and torn free. Garments not securely fastened will be torn off or tattered. Objects with large surface areas (shields, boxes, etc.) will be torn away and battered or broken as if struck a crushing blow. Creatures able to hold on to a secure object can apply their strength to effectively add 10 points per strength point, plus any weight allowance (in pounds, not gold pieces) to their effective weight. Thus, a human weighing 200 pounds with 18/00 strength and holding fast to a tree would equal 680 pounds weight. No saving throw is possible unless a victim is at the edge of the airblast; if so, either full effect or half-effect must be determined. All fully affected creatures and objects will be tumbled back along the path of the airblast for 1-6 feet per hit die of the breathing dragon. Light, flimsy objects will be blown 20-200 feet beyond the range of the airblast.\n\n'

All air-breathing creatures within the cloud are blinded for 1-4 rounds and must save vs. breath weapon or suffer 3-12 points of drowning damage each round they remain within the cloud.

A foal, raised lovingly and carefully and taken often into the vault of the sky, might become a trusted companion and steed, providing that no land bound requirements were placed upon it.

Magic weapons are needed to harm drelb; silver has no effect, unless it is magicked silver, which causes double damage. Drelb also have the facility of imitation and/or reflection of psionic power. Any power used within 30 feet of the creature or any psionic attack directed at it is imitated or reflected back upon the attacker.

Froghemoths are solitary except during spring mating season. In late spring, females lay only 10-100 eggs of about 1 foot in diameter. These eggs are left in shallow water, and when the tadhemoths hatch, about 90% are eaten by their earlier-hatching fellows or be other predators.

Most prey is slain and devoured away from the monster\'s lair, which is usually a submerged collection of trees and debris. Normal hunting/attack modes are from ambush. The monster will float with its body submerged, retractable eye-stalk thrust up to its full 3-foot height to just break water, nostril stalks likewise, and the 4 tentacles thrust ahead, possibly near shore, to seize unwary victims. Another ambush mode is for the monster to crouch amid shielding vegetation, and, when prey comes within range, it thrusts its head forward and lashes out with its 10-foot long, barbed tongue (18/50 strength) and captures the prey. The tongue retracts instantly, dragging the victim to the toothy maw to be swallowed whole on a score of 19 or 20 (14-20 if size S); otherwise, damage will be 5-50 hit points from biting/chewing.\n\n'
        'Creatures swallowed whole suffer an immediate 4-16 points of damage from digestive juices. They can attack the stomach of the monster only with dagger or similar short, stabbing weapons, excluding short swords. Each successive round inside the stomach inflicts another 4-16 points of damage. The victim is unconscious after 2 rounds. When hit points equal -10 or less, the victim is digested and totally gone. Resurrection of any sort is not then possible. If a victim seized by tongue attack is not surprised (1 or 2), the 1d6 result (3, 4, 5, or 6) is compared to a 1d8 result (1-8) rolled for the speed and accuracy of the froghemoth. If the victim\'s score equals or exceeds the froghemoth\'s, it can attempt to grab some stationary object and resist being drawn to the monster\'s mouth. If such an object is within reach, a successful grabbing and holding will result. Unless the prey\'s strength exceeds 18/50, it must compare its 1d6 score to the froghemoth\'s 1d8 score each round after being seized. Any result which is less than the 1d8 score indicates the victim\'s hold is broken, and it will be bitten or swallowed instantly. The tongue held creature cannot attack the tongue, but associates can attack it. Meanwhile, the monster will use its tentacles to damage the resisting prey and any creatures assisting it. If a froghemoth\'s tongue is severed, it will attack for 2-5 rounds with its tentacles, doing double damage (10-16 hp) with each. If it is still opposed by active opponents thereafter, it will retire to submerge and heal itself.\n\n'

After 6 months, the pectoral growths begin lengthening into tentacles, while no discernible change occurs in the rear members until the last month or two of its tadhemoth stage, when these appendages lengthen into thick, bowed legs with webbed toes.

Hangman trees are deciduous and are found in temperate to subtropical climes. Their shallow root systems and small numbers of leaves require them to supplement their nutrition by direct ingestion of protein. Thus, each tree traps prey. A hangman tree can move very slowly, its effective movement being but a few feet per day once fully grown. Saplings* move about 6 feet per hour, mature trees at about one-third that rate. All are solitary. During freezing weather, a taproot is put down and the tree is dormant. A hangman tree has no interest in any sort of treasure, and as each moves constantly, it is unlikely that any treasure will be found near one, although indigestible items will be expelled from the belly-trunk periodically. The tree attacks by dropping its noose-like appendages around prey. Although each tree has 6-9 appendages, only 3 can be controlled at one time. It takes 13-20 points to sever and destroy a vine. This is exclusive of damage to the tree proper. When in contact with a victim, the vine-like appendage is drawn tight. From 1-3 points of damage accrue to the victim each round as the vine tightens and lifts the prey (up to 1000 pounds) to the upper trunk opening. This requires 4 full rounds. On the 5th round, the victim is dropped into the acidic secretion contained within the barrel of the trunk of the hangman tree. The victim will suffer 3-12 points of acid damage per round until dead, and then digestion takes place. Escape from the trunk-stomach is nearly impossible due to sharp growths which surround the top opening and point down and inward. About 3 man-sized victims can hit within the tree\'s digestive cavity at one time.\n\n'
        'Each hangman tree has a hallucinatory perfume which it can release at will, usually doing so while prey is 30-80 feet distant. This will cause victims to believe the tree to be some ordinary sort of <a href="/creatures/quickwood">quickwood</a> or <a href="/creatures/treant">treant</a>, etc. A tree of this sort can speak haltingly in Common learned over the years. Each also has a magic resistance based on its age because it draws power from the environment. Lightning or electricity will cause double damage if used to attack the tree. Extreme cold will shock the tree into dormancy until it thaws out. Darkness also causes it to slow down its activity, although it still functions at half efficiency.\n\n'

Worse still, several small bands will occasionally amalgamate in order to raid forest communities and carry off hapless victims to some faraway spot where the keches can feast undisturbed. It is also common for these creatures to imitate calls of distress to lure prey into trapped areas and ambush. Attack is by means of clawing rakes and a bite. As keches are likely to surprise prey 5 in 6, they usually rush upon 1 or 2 selected victims, slay them, and then carry off the corpses. Their camouflage coloration and skills in woodcraft make it 50% unlikely that their tracks can be followed. They move with 50% chance of silence.\n\n'

If the creature goes without food for any 3-turn period (i.e., if no rolls are made in 30 minutes of character time), the luck eater will alter its purr slightly, causing its benefactors to attack the next creature encountered. If yet another 3 turns elapse with no food forthcoming, the aura is altered again, causing the benefactors to fight among themselves for 10 rounds or until a death occurs. However, this extreme measure effectively negates the enchantment, and the luck eater always sneaks off unnoticed near the end of such battles.

A group of mandragora typically lair in the heavy soil of a forest, favoring areas near ipp trees, briar, or willows. They develop a system of narrow burrows which enable them to attach themselves to tree roots to feed if there is no human food available. If such a lair is exposed to full daylight, the mandragoras will be stunned for 1-4 segments by the light, for they are creatures of darkness.\n\n'

Any to-hit score of 20 indicates a neck/throat hit. If appropriate, such a hit thereafter causes strangulation damage of 1-4 points per round. This reduces the mandragora\'s attacks to 1, and if the other upper appendage also hits on a score of 20, then strangulation damage is doubled, and no further attacks, other than choking constriction, are made. The strangulation will always continue until the mandragora is killed.\n\n'

The barbs are poisonous; any creature stepping on one must save vs. poison or be paralyzed for 2-40 turns. Nevertheless, the miner will not reveal its presence until all surface vibrations have ceased (i.e., no movement), at which time it will dig out and attack what it has caught, enveloping it in a manner identical to the trapper.

Slow moving and unable to leave their pool of mud, mud-men have but one aim in life which is to kill any creature entering the pool who is more mobile than themselves. Virtually all creatures, and certainly all humans and demihumans, fall into this category.\n\n'
        'In their dormant state, mud-men lie below the surface of their pool with the substance of their bodies spread throughout, feeding on the dweomer of the mud. In this state they are immune to attacks with weapons (magical or otherwise). They are, however, susceptible to spell attacks (see below).\n\n'
        'When a character or creature enters the mud pool the mud-men sense its presence immediately and take 1 round to draw together the substance of their bodies and rise to a standing position ready to attack the next round. Once fully formed and standing they may be harmed by weapons, provided the weapons are magical.\n\n'

The mud hardens on impact and slows the movement of the victim. At first the mud-men hurl only blobs of mud (maximum range 6"). These slow the movement rate of the victim by 1" if they hit. However, while hurling blobs of mud, the mud-men move toward their opponents at their full movement rate. Once within 1" they will hurl themselves (literally) rather than a mere blob. A successful hit means the death of the mud-man but it also slows the victim\'s movement by 4". A miss means that the mud-man must spend the next round re-forming to be ready to attack again.\n\n'
        'A victim is unable to move and begins to suffocate once the movement rate reaches zero, taking 1-8 points of damage per round until the mouth and/or nose is clear. The victim will die from suffocation after 5 rounds unless rescued. The hardened mud can be broken away from wholly or partially immobilized creatures. In this manner movement can be restored at a rate of 1" per 5 rounds.\n\n'

Their skin, except on their hands, oozes a substance poisonous to animal flesh. Personal contact with a myconid in most places will result in 1-4 points of damage to the creature doing the touching. Each of their pudgy hands has 2 stubby fingers and a thumb on either side. The myconids live deep underground under conditions suitable to fungi. They never venture out onto the surface, and they have a deathly fear of direct sunlight. (The exact effects of sunlight on a myconid are unknown, but they must be detrimental or the fungus men wouldn\'t fear them so.)\n\n'
        'Myconid society is based on "circles," extremely tight social groups linked by group work and melding sessions. Each circle\'s day is rigidly structured: 8 hours of rest, followed by 8 hours farming the fungus crops or doing other necessary work, followed by 8 hours of melding. For the myconids, melding is entertainment, worship, and social interaction combined. The fungoids gather in a tight circle, and the elder members release rapport and hallucinatory spores. The entire group then merges into a collective telepathic hallucination for 8 hours. Myconids consider this melding to be the reason for existence. Only distress spores will bring a circle out of meld early.\n\n'
        'A myconid circle usually consists of 20 members, 4 of each hit dice size from 1-5, i.e., 4 1-hit dice myconids, 4 2-hit dice myconids, etc. As myconids age, they continue to grow in height and weight, gaining 2 feet of height with each hit die. A 1-hit die myconid is only 2 feet tall, but the 6-hit dice king stands 12 feet tall. The damage they do in melee combat also increases with their size. Fungus men fight by clubbing with their clasped hands, doing 1d4 points of damage per hit die of size, i.e., 1 hit die myconids do 1-4 points of damage, 2-hit die myconids do 2-8 points, etc., up to the 6-hit dice king who inflicts 6-24 points of damage on a hit.\n\n'
        'The myconids also have the ability to spew forth clouds of specialized spores. The number and kind of spores they can emit increases as they grow. As each myconid advances to another size level, it gains the ability to spray another type of spores, and the number of times per day each type of spore can be emitted also increases. A myconid can emit each of its spore types a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. For example, at 3 hit dice, a myconid will be able to spray 3 different types of spores, and each may be sprayed 3 times a day. The spore types are listed and explained below, in the order in which the abilities are gained:\n\n'
        '<i>Distress</i>: This spore type is used to alert other myconids to danger or a need for aid. The cloud, which expands at the rate of 40 feet per round, will gain the attention of all myconids around the emitter. It will expand to 120 feet maximum. This ability is gained at the 1 hit die level.\n\n'
        '<i>Reproducer</i>: These spores are emitted only at the proper time for growing new myconids so that the population may be properly controlled. They are also automatically ejected by a dying myconid. This ability is gained at the 2 hit dice level.\n\n'
        '<i>Rapport</i>: These spores are used primarily in the melding process. However, they can also be used by the myconids to communicate with other species (since the fungus men do not talk). A small cloud of spores may be puffed at 1 creature; if the being fails to save vs. poison, it will be able to go into telepathic rapport with myconids, speaking mind-to-mind in a normal manner. Willing recipients of the spores may deliberately fail their save. The duration of the effect is equal in turns to the hit dice of the myconid originator. This spore-ability is gained at the 3 hit dice level.\n\n'
        '<i>Pacifier</i>: This type of spore cloud may be spewed at a single creature. If the creature fails to save vs. poison, it will be unable to do anything, becoming totally passive. The affected creature may only observe; it may take no action, even if under attack. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the hit dice of the myconid spore spewer. The pacifier spore ability is gained at the 4 hit dice level.\n\n'
        '<i>Hallucinator</i>: These spores are also primarily used in the melding ritual. However, they will affect other creatures as well. The spore cloud may be shot at 1 creature, and if that creature fails its save vs. poison, it will suffer violent hallucinations for a number of turns equal to the hit dice of the myconid responsible. Hallucinating creatures will react as follows (using 1d20):\n\n'
        '1-10: Cower whimpering\n'
        '11-15: Stare into nothingness\n'
        '16-18: Flee shrieking in a random direction\n'
        '19-20: Attack closest creature to kill\n\n'
        'The ability to emit hallucinator spores is gained at the 5 hit dice level.\n\n'
        '<i>Animator</i>: This spore ability is gained at the 6 hit dice level, the level which only the king may achieve. The king can use these spores to infect a dead person or animal. A purple fungus will cover the corpse, taking over the dead body systems and putting them back to work, animating the corpse so that it resembles a <a href="/creatures/zombie">zombie</a> (AC 10, MV 9", HD 1, HP 4, #AT 2, D bony claws for 1-3/1-3). It is not undead, however, and cannot be turned by a cleric. The animated bodies are slower than they were in life, and they always strike last in a melee round (another resemblance to zombies). The body continues to rot and the fungus gradually replaces missing parts, becoming specialized to take over their functions. Eventually, however, the decay proceeds too far, and the body stops functioning, able to rest at last. Animation takes place 1-4 days after infection, and the corpse will be animated for 2-5 weeks before it decays. Animated creatures will follow simple orders (given by the animator with rapport spores) to the best of their ability. Orders take priority over self-preservation.\n\n'
        'The myconid king is always the largest member of the fungoid colony and the only member at the 6 hit dice level. It is also the only myconid who is not a member of a circle. The other myconids regard separation from their circle with horror and pity the lonely king. The leadership role is thought of as a very unpleasant duty, almost a condemnation. However, when the old king dies, the strongest 5 hit dice myconid always assumes the role of the new king. The king must remain outside circle affairs to retain objectivity and pay close attention to the duties of leadership. The king animates guardians for the colony so that the myconids need not commit violence. It coordinates the work schedule and pays attention to affairs outside the colony that could affect the fungus men. The king also practices fungal alchemy, brewing special potions which may be useful in a time of trouble.\n\n'
        'In general, the myconids are a peaceful race, desiring only to work and meld in peace. In combat, they will avoid killing, if they can, as violence adversely affects their meld hallucinations. However, accord has never been reached between fungoid and humanoid; each views the other as a disgusting threat, and population pressures in the limited underworld inevitably cause conflicts.'

These forms are always beautiful and mostly female. Nereids are depicted as young and slim with long golden hair and pale white skin and possessing beautiful voices. Perhaps they are garbed in white and gold but they are often devoid of raiment. They have a white shawl which they carry in their hands or wear draped over their head and shoulders. In water a nereid is transparent and 95% undetectable except as golden angel seaweed.\n\n'
        'These creatures may be found in the sea, rivers, wells, mountain and cavern springs, and on the Elemental Plane of Water.

The majority of nereids are chaoctic neutral, but there are those who are very good as well as those who are diabolically evil. However, all nereids are shy and flighty and their antics have a playful quality.\n\n'

She can cause waves to crash with such a roaring sound that characters within 6" may be deafened for 3-12 rounds if precautions are not taken. Lastly, the nereid may form watery shapes which may be no more than pleasant entertainment or may become a substantial defense. This latter will take the form of a watery serpent or fist which strikes as a 4 hit dice monster and inflicts 1-4 points of damage. Only 1 of these attacks may be done per round.\n\n'

This may bring disastrous results, however, for while the kiss of a nereid can bring sweet bliss, it may also result in a watery doom. If a nereid is caught, she may save vs. poison and if successful will flow away like water. Still, if a kiss is forced from a nereid (for she is loath to give them), the player character must save vs. breath weapons at -2 or drown instantly; otherwise ecstasy is his.\n\n'

It is 90% unlikely that the "face" will be noticed unless the observer is within 30 feet of the quickwood (10 feet if the thing is attempting to conceal its presence by not using its sensory organs). These creatures may be found in any habitat which supports normal oak trees, including the warmer regions where live oaks are found.\n\n'

The roots are too strong to be broken, and blunt weapons do not damage them, but an edged weapon may be used to sever one. (Treat roots as large, with 10 hit points each.

In addition, a mature spy tree is able to cause from 2-8 other normal oaks to serve as its hosts. These trees resemble the quickwood while so possessed, having visages and sensory organs through which the master tree actually controls the hosts and gains information. Such control extends up to 36".\n\n'

The roots themselves do no damage and have a range of 30 yards.\n\n'

Lightning is harmlessly channeled off. Poisons and gases do not harm a quickwood. <a href="/spells/disintegrate-magic-user-lvl-6"><i>Disintegrate</i></a> will certainly destroy one of these things.

If the spell caster fails to make his or her saving throw, the quickwood has channeled all of the spell energy into <i>fear</i>; otherwise, the <i>fear</i> is only a side effect of the spell use, and the magic has standard effects.

They fight by slashing and lacerating with a coarse, abrasive pseudopod, Sandlings\' flexible, shifting forms are difficult to damage by physical assault (thus the armor class of 3).

An adult sandling\'s territory often swarms with thousands of infant sandlings, none larger than ½ foot in diameter. When one grows above this size, the parent sandling perceives it as a threat and kills it. When the parent sandling dies, the largest infant grows to take its place, killing all rivals (if it can). A group of sandling infants grouped together form an uneven surface and may trip an unwary creature.\n\n'

The true native shade is unknown, and no one knows if shades are connected with the <a href="/creatures/shadow">shadow</a> or some power or substance from the Plane of Shadow. The method of transmutation from living being to unliving shade life has been lost.\n\n'

Becoming a shade does not alter species limitations of ability, class, or level (except as noted hereafter). The stuff of shadow most certainly prolongs the life of shades, for unless they meet with an accident or are killed, they are undying. Disease has no effect on them once they enter a shadow, and they may regrow body parts lost in combat (save the head) in 1-4 weeks. This unnatural vitality also manifests itself in the regeneration of hit points, allowing them to regain them at 1 hit point per turn.\n\n'

        '<i>Magic Resistance</i>: Check the basic ability of the shade to resist spells vs. the light conditions. Magic resistance for a shade will never exceed 60% (a 13th-level shade fighter in twilight will have a 60% magic resistance, not 65%). Note that a shade in bright light has standard magic resistance and all saves are made at -4 on the die because of the shade\'s weakness.\n\n'
        '<i>Hit Points</i>: Penalties and bonuses are per hit die. No hit die may be less than 1 point.\n\n'
        '<i>Special Abilities</i>: All shades have the following special spell-like abilities, depending on local light conditions.\n\n'
        '<i>Shadow-walk</i> - This is the ability to gather shadows around itself and use them to transport itself to the Plane of Shadow. The transport requires 1 full round.\n\n'
        '<i>Shadow images</i> - This is the ability to form exact duplicates of itself out of shadow and cause the duplicates to act as if they were living entities. A shade can create 2-5 shadow images and can control their actions as long as they remain within 30 feet of their creator. They may only be dispelled by altering the lighting conditions around the shade. Note that shadow images have no material substance (so they do no damage in their attacks), and that the shade must draw from surrounding shadow to create them.\n\n'
        '<i>Other Abilities</i>: All shades may hide in shadows in conditions of twilight, shadowy light, and night/dark. They hide as a thief of the same level. Shades with thieving ability gain 2% per level in shadowy conditions, and 5% per level in night/dark conditions.\n\n'
        'As mentioned before, becoming a shade does not change the basic characteristics of the individual. Those having psionic abilities may have those powers enhanced, but psionic ability will lose all mastery in the disciplines of <a href="/spells/invisibility-magic-user-lvl-2"><i>invisibility</i></a> and <i>etherealness</i> but will gain 2 levels in <i>dimension walking</i> when in shadows. Shades with psionic abilities usually gain the ability of <i>shape alteration</i> (10% chance per year as a shade), if they do not already have this power. The psionic strength of gifted shades will alter upon attaining shadehood because ability scores will be changed. New power and discipline gained by such a shade will operate only on the Plane of Shadow.\n\n'
        'Finally, it is nearly impossible to detect a shade, for its appearance does not differ greatly from its mortal form. A shade\'s eyes show no white, however, just a dark gray or purple iris and pupil, and its skin tone becomes dusky and gray. They prefer garb of gray or black and will rarely wear brightly-colored clothes. The transformation to shade has some evil in it, for the shade becomes gloomy and brooding. They are generally solitary due to this fact, as they cannot trust other shades, nor can they deal with normal creatures without dominating or exploiting them.'

For example, if a magic-user casts a <a href="/spells/lightning-bolt-magic-user-lvl-3"><i>lightning bolt</i></a> at a spectator, the spectator rolls a saving throw to see if the spell is reflected, and if it is not then it rolls for its magic resistance percentage.

If the magic-user makes the saving throw, he or she takes no damage whatsoever!

The rush of the tarrasque is possible but once every turn, because the monster is so large and ponderous.\n\n'

The reflection is such that 1 in 6 such attacks actually reflect directly back upon the caster, while the remainder bounce harmlessly away from the monster. Fire of any sort has no effect upon the tarrasque. The monster\'s metabolic rate is such that it regenerates 1 hit point per round after sustaining damage. The tarrasque can be struck only by <i>+1</i> or better magic weapons.\n\n'
        'The slaying of the tarrasque is said to be possible only if the monster is reduced to -30 or fewer hit points and a <a href="/spells/wish-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>wish</i></a> for its death then used. Otherwise, even the slightest piece of the tarrasque will regenerate and restore the monster completely. Legend says that a great treasure can be extracted from the tarrasque\'s carapace. The upper portion, treated with acid and then heated in a furnace, will yield gems - 10-100 diamonds of 1000 gp base value each. The underbelly material, mixed with the creature\'s blood and meteoric iron, will produce a metal which can be forged by dwarf blacksmiths into 1-4 shields of <i>+5</i> magical power.\n\n'
        'It is fortunate that the tarrasque is active only for short periods of time. Typically, the monster comes forth to forage for a week or two, ravaging all but a few square miles of land. The tarrasque then seeks a hidden lair underground and lies dormant, sleeping for 5-20 months before coming forth again. Once every decade or so, the monster will be particularly active, staying abroad for several months. Thereafter its period of dormancy becomes 4-16 years long unless disturbed. The ratio of active to dormant state appears to be about 1:30.'

In addition, as these creatures exist across multiple times, there is only 1 chance in 10 that any spell cast or magic employed against or upon a time elemental will actually affect it. (To determine this, roll 1d10 to find its current center of vulnerability, then roll a second 1d10 to see if it matches the first number rolled. If so, the spell or magic works.) Again, any opponent able to move through time can determine where the time elemental is most vulnerable, so magic or spells used by such an opponent will function properly, although the time elemental is still allowed a saving throw.\n\n'
        'Noble time elementals have all the power of common ones. In addition, each has the power to cast a <a href="/spells/time-stop-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>time stop</i></a> spell (which will affect even time elementals of common sort), age a creature by 1-20 years, make a creature younger by 1-20 years, age nonliving vegetable matter by 10-200 years, age mineral material by 100-2000 years, and move up to 4 other creatures along time (forward, backward, or sideways) randomly, or to a desired locale, singly or jointly, providing the creatures are willing to go or fail to save vs. spells. Each power is usable per round, at will, once per day. Time elementals seldom appear on any plane but that of Time; on other planes they feel discomfort and the weight of the forward (or other) motion of time in relation to the plane upon which one of their manifestations exist. Similarly, time elementals cannot be conjured, summoned, or otherwise brought into being by any standard means or known spell.\n\n'
        'On the Time Plane there are other creatures dissimilar to time elementals. There are also said to be certain royal time elementals of greater power than even the nobles\'. These creatures rule their fellows and serve certain deities. Royal time elementals have 24 or 28 hit dice, cause the same number of hit points of attack damage (6-24 or 7-28), and have double the number of powers. In addition, royal time elementals can summon 1-4 common (70%) or 1-2 noble elementals (30%) once per day.'

Regardless of its locale, the verme prefers warm water with an abundance of food, such as fish, reptiles, cattle, humans, or virtually anything else. Although the verme is long, it is flattish along its belly and wider than it is high. This enables it to lurk on the bottom and swim in relatively shallow water. The verme\'s head is heavily scaled and very bony, thus giving it an armor class of 3, while the body is less well protected. Because the verme swallows prey whole - even that as large as a water buffalo - the stomach can contain metallic or other items of indigestible nature (such as gems, crystals, etc.). Swallowing occurs on any hit if prey is not more than 12 feet tall. Damage (3d8+4) is incurred during the swallowing process. Swallowed creatures receive 2-16 points of additional damage per round. Any swallowed being will be dissolved in 6 rounds. The monster is able to upset vessels of up to small galley size when hungry and seeking food. Its thick, slime-covered scales make edged weapons useless, such attacks inflicting but 1 point of damage per blow. Fire-based attacks cause only one-half damage to the verme, unless the attack strikes the inside of the mouth or somewhere internally. In the latter case, damage is at a factor of +1 per die.\n\n'

They do not eat very much at a single meal, and metal weighing 5-8 pounds is quite enough to satiate one for 1-4 days. Xaren speak a bizarre tongue but telepathy or knowledge of tongues can aid one in understanding them. They will approach and seek a hand-out.

The 3rd round it hits the opponent\'s plate mail (armor class 3), which turns to dust but does not change the zorbo\'s armor class or damage.'

    description = ('Zygoms are small individual fungoid growths which consist of a short, thin stem with an ovoid cap. One or 2 dozen such growths are joined by a rhizome structure to form a singular communal creature, a zygom. Although able to exist in earth, zygoms prefer to infest living flesh and nourish themselves on the host\'s blood and tissue. This infestation controls the host creature by brain and nerve connections. It leads to death in 1-8 weeks, depending on the size and constitution of the host creature. The zygom remains until the whole of the dead body is consumed and then moves on. As host creatures are controlled, they move, attack, and defend according to the dictates of the possessing zygoms. Infestation is typically on head, neck, and back (spinal) areas. Typical host creatures are: <a href="/creatures/giant-ant">ants (giant)</a>, <a href="/creatures/giant-rat"><i>rats (giant)</a>, <a href="/creatures/osquip">osquips</a>, and occasionally small humanoids. Whenever a colony of zygoms comes into rough contact with any creature, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the pale blue "milk" of a broken cap will stick fast to the creature. This milk is extremely sticky, and it has the power to glue materials together for 2-5 days before the substance drys and crumbles. If glued to flesh, a colony of zygom spores will infect the creature and begin growth by the time the glue powders, allowing the zygoms to infest and control the host. Only a <a href="/spells/cure-disease-cleric-lvl-3"><i>cure disease</i></a> will remove infestation. Zygom glue can be otherwise embarassing, for it will stick weapons to targets, creatures to creatures, etc.\n\n'
