It is typically encountered only due to conjuration by a cleric, although these creatures roam the ethereal and astral planes and when encountered there can be dimly seen. An aerial servant is normally invisible. Aerial servants do not fight per se, but they are exceedingly strong and very fast. They can carry weights in excess of 10,000 gold pieces, and if they grasp any creature it requires an 18 strength to have <i>any</i> chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the creature has, there is a like chance to escape the grasp of the aerial servant, i.e. a human with an 18/50% strength has a 50% chance of breaking free of the grasp, and a 00% or 19 indicates automatic breaking of the grasp. They travel at twice the speed on an <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker/">invisible stalker</a>, and when on the physical plane they are able to achieve surprise on a die roll of 1-4 (out of 6). If the aerial servant is frustrated from completion of its assigned mission it becomes insane, returns to the cleric which sent it forth, and attacks as a double strength <a href=\"/creatures/invisible-stalker/\">invisible stalker</a>. Likewise, if it is encountered ethereally or astrally the aerial servant will typically attack in the same fashion.

This causes farmers great consternation, since the anhkheg likes to supplement its earthly diet of soil with a bit of fresh meat, human or otherwise. Since its mouth is not designed to rip and tear meat, its mandibles crush its prey and secrete a digestive enzyme causing an additional 1-4 points per round until the prey is completely dissolved. If sorely pressed in battle it is able to squirt its digestive acids 30 feet once per six hours. However when it does this it cannot digest anything for the same length of time, so it usually will bite. A squirt of digestive acid causes 8-32 hit points of damage to the creature struck, half the amount if the creature makes its saving throw. The anhkheg\'s favorite method of attacking is lying 5-10 feet underneath the ground until its antenna detects a likely victim passing overhead. Then it burrows out directly underneath the prey and grabs it.\n\nThe anhkheg has a chitinous shell which is brownish in color. Its underside is pinkish. The creature\'s eyes are glistening black.'

The globular body of this monster is supported by levitation, and it floats slowly about as it wills. Atop the sphere are 10 eyestalks, while in its central area are a great eleventh eye and a large mouth filled with pointed teeth. The body is protected by a hard chitinous covering. The creature\'s eyestalks and eyes are also protected, although less well (thus the armor classes of 2 and 7 respectively). Because of its particular nature the beholder is able to withstand the loss of its eyestalks, these members are not computed as part of its hit point damage potential, and lost eyestalks will eventually grow back (1 week per lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand one-third this total, i.e. a beholder with 45 hit points can withstand 30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed; the eleventh eye can withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. Eyestalks take from 8 to 12 hit points each before being lost. The body of the beholder represents 75% of potential hit area, the central eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.\n\n<i>Eyes</i>: The various eyes of a beholder each have a different function. Typically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks are able to function considering that the attack is coming from an arc 90° before the monster. If attacks come from 180° double the number of eyestalks able to function, and for 270° or 360° triple or quadruple the number. Attacks from above enable all 10 eyestalks to function, but the central eye cannot.

The body structure of a black pudding is such that it can pass (flow) through narrow openings (such as a 1" crack under a door). The monster travels equally well on walls or ceilings as well as floors. Its tiny mouths and saliva do 3-24 hit points of damage per melee round to exposed flesh.

Black puddings also eat away metal with their corrosive saliva: Chainmail in 1 melee round, plate mail in 2, and an additional melee round for magical armor at a rate of 1 melee round for each plus of armor. Thus, +1 magic (plate) armor would have to be in contact with a black pudding for 3 melee rounds before it dissolved. If chopped or struck, the monster is broken into two or more parts, each able to attack. The same is true if it is attacked by lightning. Cold does not affect it. Fire causes normal damage to this monster, and they avoid flames. Black puddings sometimes have color variation, gray, brown, and white being not uncommon.\n\nBlack puddings with 10-20 hit points are about 5\' diameter, those of 21-40 hit points 6\', 41-60 are 7\', and 61-80 are 8\'. Note that even those of the smallest size (or those as small as 1\' diameter) are able to deliver normal damage.

The catoblepas\' neck is long and thin, and perched atop it is a big head uglier than that of a warthog. Its legs are thick and stumpy, much like a hippopotamus. The creature\'s tail is strong and snakey however, and moves with amazing swiftness to strike enemies. Any creature so struck has a base 75% chance of being stunned for 1-10 melee rounds; the base chance being modified by adjustment downward by 5% for every level (or hit die for monsters) above 1. Thus, if an 11th level character is struck by the tail there is only a 25% chance of stunning. Perhaps its habitat - fetid swamps and miasmal marshes - caused the bizarre combination of genetic characteristics in this monster, or perhaps it was due to some ghastly tinkering with life by a demented godling. In any case, the most horrid aspect of the catoblepas is its bloodshot eyes.\n\nThe gaze of the catoblepas is equal to a <a href="/spells/death-spell-magic-user-lvl-6/">death</a> ray, extending 6" from the eyes (even into the astral and ethereal planes). Any creature which meets this gaze dies without a chance to save itself. Complete surprise (a 2 on 6-sided die) means one of the party encountering the monster has met its gaze. Otherwise the very weak neck on the catoblepas has only a 25% chance of raising the head enough to use its eyes. If both parties are still this chance increases by 15% per melee round. If the monster must follow quick movements, or if it is shambling along in pursuit of prey, there is only a 10% chance per melee round of the neck raising the head sufficiently high to fix its gaze. A fleeing victim, even with eyes averted, is subject to the deadly effect of the catoblepas\' eyes, although there is a saving throw.'

        '<b>Tallfellow</b>: A taller (4+\'), slimmer halfling, with fairer skin and hair. Tallfellows are very rare. They use more armor (AC 6), ride ponies and carry more spears. It is possible for exceptionally strong (17, 18) tallfellows to work to 5th or 6th level of fighting ability. They can speak <a href="/creatures/elf">elvish</a> and are very friendly with elves. They live for about 180 years on the average.\n\n'
        '<b>Stout</b>: This kind of halfling is a bit smaller (3½+\') and stockier than the typical (hairfeet). They use more armor also (AC 6), and employ morning stars in addition to the usual halflingish arms. Very strong stouts (18) are able to work up to 5th level fighting ability. Stouts have infravision and can detect sloping passageways. They have no fear of water and can swim. These halflings are able to speak <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarvish</a> and enjoy dwarven company. Stouts reach the age of 200 or more years.'

Once set upon a mission, an invisible stalker will follow through unceasingly until it is accomplished. They are faultless trackers within one day of a quarry\'s passing. They must be destroyed to make them cease an ordered attack. Once a mission is finished, the creature is freed to return to its own plane. The invisible stalker is at best an unwilling servant but will not resent a brief, uncomplicated task. Service involving a period of a week tries the creature severely, and anything longer is certain to make it attempt to fulfill the letter of command by perverting the spirit of it. This is not to say that impelling the invisible stalker to serve for extended periods is impossible, but the compulsion to cause it to do so fully and properly must be great, i.e. a carefully worded command from a very powerful magic-user. A simple command such as "Follow me, and guard me from any attack," could be interpreted to follow at 100\' distance if the invisible stalker had been on duty over a week - or perhaps even if it hadn\'t been that long, for dealing with such creatures is always a hazard. Similarly, a command to: "Keep me safe from all harm," can be construed by the invisible stalker that it is to carry the conjuring party to its own plane and place them in suspended animation in a secret room in its own abode, thus carrying out its duties to the letter.\n\n'
        'Each day of duty which an invisible stalker serves will see a 1% cumulative chance of the creature seeking to pervert the intent of its commands in order to be free of servitude. If no option remains open, the stalker must continue to serve.\n\n'

A mature purple worm can swallow, whole, a creature as large as 8\' or so tall and up to 6\' wide, or vice versa. Any creature swallowed will be dead in 6 melee rounds. The worm will digest its meal in 12 turns, and at that time the creature is totally gone and cannot be raised from the dead. Note, however, that a creature swallowed can try to cut its way out of the purple worm\'s stomach. The inner armor class of the worm is 9, but each round the creature is in the worm it subtracts 1 from the damage each of its attacks does. This subtraction is cumulative, so on the second melee round there is a -2, on the third a -3, etc.\n\n'
        'Additionally, the purple worm has a poisonous stinger in its tail. This weapon is only used in rear defense, however, or if the worm is fighting large or numerous opponents in a very spacious area which will allow it freedom to use its stinger. The sting causes 2-8 hit points of damage when it his, and if the victim fails its poison saving throw it is killed by the purple worm\'s poison.\n\n'

If a cleric is with the group in the lair, she will be of 5th to 8th level ability, and her lesser clerics will be 3rd or 4th level.\n\n'
        'There are always 2-8 <a href="/creatures/shark">sharks</a> with sahuagin in their lair. Sahuagin are able to make these monsters obey simple one or two word commands.\n\n'
        'Whenever a sahuagin lair is encountered there is a 5% chance that it will be the stronghold of a prince. The prince will have 8 hit dice +8 hit points, 9 guards of chieftain strength, and there will be 1 8th level sahuagin evil high priestess and 4 4th level underclerics. The number of males, females, hatchlings and eggs in a prince\'s lair is double the number rolled. There will be 4-24 sharks present at all times.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin lairs are actual villages or towns, constructed of stone. The buildings are domed, and the seaweed and similar marine plants growing around and on these buildings make them hard to detect.\n\n'
        'Although these creatures do not wear armor, their scaly hides are very tough and equal to armor class 5. Sahuagin wear a harness to carry their personal gear and weapons. A group of these creatures is typically armed as follows:\n'
        '30% spear & dagger\n'
        '50% trident, net & dagger\n'
        '20% heavy crossbow & dagger\n\n'
        'Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks which make escape from one virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by 3 javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30\' underwater, normally above water. Nets are used to entrap victims. Tridents have three uses: to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin are well-equipped to attack even without weapons, for they have long, sharp claws on their webbed hands which can inflict 1-2 hit points per attack, and they can use both simultaneously. Their powerful rear legs are likewise taloned, and if they kick an opponent with them they inflict 1-4 hit points damage with each hit from either foot. The sahuagin\'s mouth is filled with teeth and fangs, and if one successfully bites an opponent, from 1-4 points of damage will be inflicted. Thus it is possible for an unarmed sahuagin to attack 3 or 5 times in a melee round causing 1-2/1-2/1-4 and 1-4/1-4 if the legs can rake.\n\n'
        'The eyes and ears of these monsters are particularly keen. Sahuagin can see 30" underwater at 100\' depth. For each 100\' of greater depth, their vision is reduced 1", i.e. at 500 they can see 26", at 1,000 they can see 21". Their ears are so sharp as to be able to detect the clinking of metal at 1 mile, or a boat oar splashing at the same distance. However, at 24" or less their ears cannot detect the sounds of swimming or similar noise, although the sahuagin can still hear metallic or other clanks, clicks, thuds, etc.\n\n'
        'Sahuagin speark their own tongue, and some are evidently able to converse with the ixitxachitl in their own language.\n\n'
        '<i>Description</i>: A typical sahuagin is blackish green on the back shading to green on the belly. The fins are black. The great staring eyes are deep, shining black. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with 4 arms which are completely usable. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are light colored, but they darken and attain full growth approximately 1-2 months after hatching.\n\n'
        '<i>History and Legend</i>: The sahuagin are chronicled because of their evil, having time and again raided the land, desolating whole coasts, and, of course, destroying passing ships continually. The exact origin of the sahuagin is unknown. It is suggested that they were created from a nation of particularly evil humans by the most powerful of lawful evil gods in order to preserve them when the deluge came upon the earth. The <a href="/creatures/triton">tritons</a>, however, are purported to have stated that sahuagin are distantly related to the sea elves, claiming that the drow spawned the sahuagin.\n\n'
        'Few persons have survived capture by the sahuagin, for prisoners are usually imprisoned, tortured, and eaten. Creatures taken alive are brought to the sahuagins\' lair and confined in cells. Although the sahuagin are able to stay out of water for up to 4 hours, there is no air in the confinement areas in the typical village, but in towns of the nobles there are special quarters to maintain air-breathing creatures. The sahuagin will set aside a few prisoners to torture and provide sport - typically a fight to the death between two different creatures in an arena. The bulk of captives are simply killed and eaten. It is seldom that any prisoner escapes, although the sahuagin find sport in allowing captives to think they have found freedom, only to be encircled by sadistic guards while a school of sharks come for the kill.\n\n'
        'The sahuagin are cruel and brutal, the strongest always bullying the weaker. Any injured, disabled, or infirm specimen will be slain and eaten by these cannibalistic monsters. Even imperfect hatchlings are dealt with in this fashion. This strict law has developed a strong race, however, and any leader is always subject to challenge. Sahuagin never stop growing, although they grow slowly, and death comes to most before many years allow growth to large size. Leaders are the largest and strongest. It is reported that the 9 princes of the sahuagin are each of the 4-armed sort, as is the king. In any event, the loser of a challenge duel is always slain - in combat or afterwards. Duels are fought without weapons, only fang and claw being permitted.\n\n'
        'The king is supposed to inhabit a city somewhere at the greatest depth sahuagin can exist. This place is supposedly built in an undersea canyon, with palaces and dwellings built along either face. There, fully 5,000 of these monsters dwell, not counting the king\'s retinue of queens, concubines, nobles, guards, etc. said to number 1,000 or more. The king of the sahuagin is reported as huge of size (10 hit dice +10 hit points) and of greatest evil. He is always accompanied by 9 noble guards (6 hit dice +6) and the evil high priestess of all sahuagin, with her train of 9 under-clerics.'

The trapper then crushes them doing a base damage of 4 plus the armor class of the victim per turn of crushing. Those entrapped are unable to use weapons, for the great musculature of the trapper prevents it. Prey will be smothered in 6 melee rounds regardless of the damage sustained.

    description = ('The aarakocra are a race of intelligent avian humanoids. Their society consists of small tribes of about 11-30; each tribe has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles. The bird-men live on high peaks in the mountains, where they can soar all day on the winds and the thermals.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra have little to do with humankind beyond the occasional poaching of a farm animal (they appear incapable of distinguishing between domestic and wild animals, for this act is not one motivated by malice). They have even less to do with demi-humans and actively dislike humanoids. Infrequently, an aarakocra may agree to give information to, or act as a scout for, humans, in exchange for shiny coins or gems. As they are extremely reluctant to leave their familiar mountains such an act will only very rarely take place outside the bird-man\'s own territory.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra stand about 5\' high but they have a wing span of 20\'. Their wings/arms are built somewhat like those of a <a href="/creatures/pteranodon">pterodactyl</a>, with a hand half-way along each leading edge. The wing-section beyond the hand has as its leading edge an extremely lengthened and strengthened outer finger which locks in place during flight. The wing-hands cannot grasp while in flight, but when the bird-man is on the ground and the wings are folded back, the hands are nearly as useful as normal human hands. Each hand consists of three normal-sized fingers and an opposable thumb.\n\n'
        'The bird-man\'s might wing muscles are anchored in a bony keel which projects forward from the chest a full foot beyond the normal extent of a human chest. The legs are powerful, with "backward-bending" knees and dangerous-looking talons on the feet. The feet are actually more dangerous than they appear: the talons can unlock and fold back, uncovering a pair of fully-functional hands, each with three tough, powerful fingers and a thumb.\n\n'
        'It is these nether "hands" that the bird-man employs in aerial combat, either using the talons alone or clutching heavy fletched javelins, used for stabbing or throwing. Each feathered warrior usually carries half a dozen of these javelins, which do 2-8 hit points of damage each, strapped to its chest in individual sheaths. Aarakocra are remarkably adept at flinging these javelins while in the air, incurring none of the "to hit" penalties used in aerial missile fire.\n\n'
        'Their most devastating form of attack is to dive upon a victim with a javelin in each nether hand, building up great speed. The bird-man pulls out of the dive just as it reaches its target and snaps the javelins forward into its prey with great force and accuracy, meanwhile emitting a blood-curdling shriek. Such attacks are at +4 hit probability and do double damage if successful, but the aarakocra needs at least 200\' of dive to perform them properly.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra share with <a href="/creatures/eagle">eagles</a> the ability to plummet a great distance vertically downwards and pull out at the last moment. Rather than fling it away, a bird-man will save its last javelin for stabbing purposes in battle.\n\n'
        'The aarakocra are oviparous and the females tend the eggs during their 8-month incubation period. It is these temporarily nest-bound females which fabricate all the javelins, tools and other small items the tribe uses (the males do no work other than hunting). The females also weave the brilliant feathered banners and pennants which fly above the tribal nest and mark out their territory (each tribe has a unique, highly individual design). The sight of an aarakocra weaving is said to be impressive, as they do so while resting on their backs and using all four hands at the same time. Individually, their hands are not as dextrous as those of a human, but the extra pair more than compensates for this.\n\n'
        'Aarakocra speak their own language and that of the giant eagles, with which they are on mutually respectful terms. 10% of aarakocra also speak the common tongue. They get on very well with all forms of <a href="/creatures/air-elemental">air elemental</a>, and any five aarakocra can summon an air elemental by chanting and flying through an intricate aerial dance (this takes three melee rounds). The air elemental will comply with the bird-men\'s requests as a favor, but will not fight to the death on their behalf, returning to its own plane (if it can) before such an eventuality could occur. The bird-men are known to have tribal shamans.\n\n'
        'Color of plumage among the aarakocra varies from tribe to tribe, but the males are always crested and gaudier than the females. This is especially true during the once-yearly mating season when the plumage of the males shows up in particularly striking fashion. Their beaks are about 5" long, gray-black and in shape somewhat between that of a parrot and an eagle. The beak can deliver a nasty bite (1-3 hit points of damage) but is rarely used for fighting unless the bird-man is trapped on the ground. Their faces are in no way similar to human faces, though their eyes are set frontally on the head to provide binocular vision, and in fact their sight is so keen that they can distinguish detail at considerable distances. Though they are powerful, they are also light - an adult weight is typically in the range 50-80 pounds - and are unwilling to become involved in ground melee or fights which could result in grappling, since their hollow bones are quite fragile and could break if, for instance, a bird-man is thrown heavily to the ground. The aarakocra are extremely susceptible to claustrophobia. Such is their fear of being closed in that they will not even enter buildings, and only a mad or insanely desperate bird-man would venture below ground.\n\n'

Though flightless (the rudimentary wings are scarcely visible and will not support flight), a bird often eludes pursuers with its long strides. Its movement rate is unaffected by the loss of a single leg, but the loss of two legs halves movement rate.

The natural host is human, but assassin bugs have been known to lay their eggs in demi-humans and (rarely) humanoids.\n\n'

The projection is physical in the sense that it can receive and inflict damage - in this respect it is a duplicate of the original. The berbalang can use all of the senses of the projection in its quest for food. The projection can range up to 3 miles from the material berbalang body.

Once such detail has been discerned, it will be clear to the observer that one of the "hands" of the female, held close to her side, carries a slim sword which blends into the rest of the stone so smoothly that it is near-invisible.\n\n'

This might be to guard a treasure-chest, to prevent intrusion into a particular area or another similar task. This task will have been set by the creator who, if near at hand when the column animates, will be able to control it with simple verbal commands.

These villages are always ruled by a <a href="/creatures/dark-stalker">dark stalker</a>.\n\n'

The creeper also has the innate power to <i>create darkness</i> three times a day - when this power is used, all torches, lanterns and other non-magical sources of illumination within 50\' are extinguished and cannot be re-ignited during the next hour (the duration of the creeper\'s power). During this time the creeper has two main objectives. First, to destroy lanterns and tinderboxes, break flasks of oil and so on - any act which will inhibit the creation of illumination. Secondly, to steal any small magical items detected. Self-preservation ranks marginally above such objectives.\n\n'

    description = ('Ages past, when the <a href="/creatures/elf">elvenfolk</a> were but new to the face of the earth, their number was torn by discord and those of better disposition drove from them those of the elves who were selfish and cruel. However constant warfare between the two divisions of elvenkind continued, with the goodly ones ever victorious, until those of dark nature were forced to withdraw from the lands under the skies and seek safety in the realm of the underworld. Here, in lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages and caves hung with icicles of stone, the dark elvenfolk - the drow - found both refuge and comfort. Over the centuries they grew strong once again and schooled themselves in arcane arts. And though they were strong enough to face and perhaps defeat their former brethren in battle, the drow no longer desired to walk upon the green lands under the sun and stars. They no longer desired a life in the upper world, being content with the gloomy fairyland beneath the earth that they had made their own. Yet they neither forgave nor forgot, and even now, above all else, they bear enmity for all of their distant kin - elves and faeries - who drove them down beneath the earth and now dwell in the meadows and dells of the bright world. Though they are seldom if ever seen by any human or demi-human, the drow still persist, occasionally entering lower dungeon levels and consorting with other creatures in order to work out their schemes and inflict revenge upon those who inhabit the world above.\n\n'
        'Regardless of the number of drow appearing, there will always be one of higher level than the main body. Drow males are all at least 2nd level fighters - some are as high as 7th level in fighting ability. Males can also be magic-users, some as high as 12th level. Female drow are also at least 2nd level fighters and some have attained 9th level as fighters. Most drow clerics are female, and no upper limit to their level of ability is known; however no male drow cleric has been known to be higher than 4th level.\n\n'
        'Drow wear a fine mesh armor of exquisite workmanship. It is made of an alloy of steel containing adamantite. Even the lowliest fighters have in effect +1 chainmail, with higher level drow having +2, +3, +4 or even +5 chainmail. Small bucklers are also used - shields of unusual shape - those drow of greater experience level and importance in drow society having bucklers fashioned of adamantite so as to be +1, +2, or even +3 value.\n\n'
        'As will be described later, all drow move silently and with graceful speed, even when wearing their black mesh of armor. Each drow carries a small amount of personal wealth in a soft leather bag worn around the neck beneath the mail. In addition they arm themselves with long dagger and short sword of adamantite alloy (+1 to as high as +3 or even +4 borne by noblefolk); 50% or more carry small crossbows which are held in one hand (6" range light crossbow) and shoot darts coated with a poison which renders the victim unconscious (save is at -4). These darts also inflict 1-3 points of damage on a victim. A few drow also carry adamantite maces (+1 to +5) and/or small javelins (also poisoned with the same substance as the darts) with atlatls (9" range, +3/+2/+1 to hit at short/medium/long range).\n\n'
        'Drow have superior infravision of the 12" range variety and move with silence. The black boots and cloaks that Drow wear are similar to <i>cloaks</i> and <i>boots of elvenkind</i>, except that the wearer has only a 75% chance of surprising enemies or blending into shadows. The material will not cut easily and cloaks have a +6 to saving throws vs. fire attacks; however, any alteration to the cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material and making it useless. Drow themselves are only 12½% (1 in 8) likely to be surprised by opponents. Drow are also both intelligent and highly co-ordinated, being able to use either or both hands/arms for attack and defense. They make saving throws versus all forms of magic (clerical included) spells, whether from a caster or from a device, at +2. Drow magic resistance increases by 2% for each level of experience they have gained, with multi-classed individuals gaining this bonus for but one of their classes (the highest). Thus, a 7th level Drow is 64% resistant to any magic and will save at +2 against any magic which could have an effect.\n\n'

If they are attacking targets inside the radius of <i>light</i> or <i>continual light</i> spells, the bright illumination causes them to suffer a "to hit" penalty of -1 and the converse +1 on saving throws against such attacks is awarded to the target creatures. If bright light exists, it is 75% likely that drow will retire from the situation because of the illumination, unless such a retreat would imperil one of their number, would otherwise be harmful to their desired ends or would expose some important feature to the light-bringing intruders. In any event, such dimmer light sources as torches, lanterns, magic weapons, <a href="/creatures/giant-fire-beetle">fire beetle</a> essence or <spells/faerie-fire-druid-lvl-1"><i>faerie fire</i></a> do not adversely affect the performance of the dark elves.\n\n'

All of the dark elves also have a <i>silent language</i> composed of hand movements, and this means of communication is highly sophisticated, being able to convey much information to a considerable degree of complexity. When drow are within 30\' of each other, they use facial and body expression, movement and posture; these latter means of communication alone are capable of conveying considerable information, and when coupled with hand/finger movements the whole is as erudite as any spoken speech.\n\n'

When these are exposed to direct sunlight, irreversible decay starts and the items will become totally useless in 2-12 days. If protected from sunlight, they will retain their special properties for 31-50 days before becoming normal items; and if exposed to the radiations of the Drow homeland for a period of 1 week out of every 4 weeks, the items could remain potent indefinitely.

This ray strikes a victim as though he were AC10; the victim must make his saving throw against death ray or die instantly. Victims who make their saving throw take 3-18 hit points of damage.

        'The hellcat is invisible in the presence of any light-source, but in darkness it can be seen as a faintly-glowing <a href="/creatures/wraith">wraith</a>-like outline with blazing crimson eyes, in form resembling a <a href="/creatures/domestic-cat">domestic cat</a> the size of a <a href="/creatures/tiger">tiger</a>.\n\n'
        'It can only be harmed by magical weapons, and even then the magical damage bonuses do not apply (so, for example, a +2 dagger would do 1-4 hit points of damage rather than 3-6 if it hit).

        'If a hellcat is encountered which is not already attached to a character or a creature, the hellcat will select the most powerful member of the party with lawful evil alignment and will serve him. If there are two or more members of the party with that alignment and of equally high experience levels, the hellcat will choose a cleric over other classes, then a magic-user or illusionist, followed by a fighter and then other classes. Once it has selected a master, the hellcat will serve that person in the performance of evil deeds, will protect and defend that person and communicate only with him, using <i>telepathy</i> of range 9". It will only serve intelligent creatures of the lawful evil alignment.\n\n'
        'The attachment of the hellcat to its master can be broken in two ways. First, a hellcat will always give up its current master for a new, more powerful, master of the lawful evil alignment whenever such is encountered, providing the potential new master will remain intact). The creature, if it selects and is received by a new master, will have no compunctions about attacking its former master if ordered to do so. It is therefore possible for a character to "steal" a hellcat from one monster only to have it "stolen" from him, in turn, by another.\n\n'
        'Secondly, the hellcat can only remain on the <i>Prime Material Plane</i> in the service of a master for a year and a day, after which it must return to its home in <i>Hell</i>. It may return again subsequently, but its bond with its former master is not automatically re-established. If the master encounters the creature again he may acquire its services in the same manner as before.\n\n'
        'The only demand the hellcat makes in return for its service is the payment of one living human victim per week as its meal. The master must supply the victim - if he fails to do so, he will fill that role personally.\n\n'
        'A hellcat attacks with two claws for 2-5 hit points of damage each and a bite for 2-12 hit points of damage.\n\n'
        'If a party encounters a hellcat which is already in the service of a person or creature, the hellcat may switch its allegiance as described above or it may remain in the service of its existing master.\n\n'

If the party contains one or more persons or creatures of evil disposition (i.e. neutral evil or chaotic evil) the hellcat will flee. However if the party contains no person or creature with an evil alignment, in any combination, the hellcat will attack.'

If the jermlaine are in their lair, it is 50% probable that there will be connecting rat tunnels). This cohabitation extends to all forms of mutual co-operation and defense.\n\n'

This injury to the adventurers brings both personal gain to the jermlaine and the possibility of eventual gain of new victims.\n\n'

In addition to a dart, each minimus carries a pike-like weapon - a 1½\' long wand of supple wood with a sharp metal tip. This instrument is used as a spear or pike to inflict 1-4 hit points of damage. Their favored attack method is to ambush with pit or net, however, taking victims alive.\n\n'

Note that beating with the clubs has a 2% cumulative chance per blow of knocking the victim unconcious, but those protected by splint, banded or plate mail will not be so attacked. Well-armored victims who cannot be bound fast are attacked to kill - possibly with flaming oil missiles or acid. Some victims will be devoured by the jermlaine (or their rat-friends) but most humans will be stripped naked, shaved and left trussed and helpless in the passageway.

Their vandalism will usually be noticed only 1-12 turns later, when a weakened strap parts, a seam opens fully etc. Worse still, if packs and other goods are placed out where jinxkins can reach them, these monstrous atomites will pollute the water, sour the wine and turn it into vinegar, spoil food, desecrate holy water, steal small items (gems, coins, garlic buds, herbs, etc.) wedge daggers or swords so that they are difficult to draw out quickly, cut bow strings, blunt arrows, puncture oil flasks and so on.\n\n'

Coupled with their ability to move quietly, the jinxkins are likely to surprise opponents on a roll of 1-5 (d6) and they are 75% undetectable if looked or listened for, unless the action is done suddenly so as to catch them off their guard.\n\n'

They "swim" along the layers of rock in small schools, riding on earth movements and the shifting of geological strata as if swimming - or surfing - in the sea. When they find a suitable vein of ore, they settle down to feed and ingest the material, grinding it up and, through their curious metabolic and digestive processes, actually separating out and refining the metal. The slaggy waste material is excreted and the metal is deposited in the khargra\'s internal reservoirs, there to be assimilated slowly into the body.\n\n'
        'Naturally a khargra prefers refined metal to unrefined ore, and if the former is sensed reasonably close to hand, it will forego its normal diet for this new rich source of food. Khargra consider armor and weaponry a tasty meal indeed and are particularly fond of "eating" metallic treasure.\n\n'
        'Khargra will leap from the wall or floor of a cavern or subterranean passage like fish leaping from water, flying as far as 10\'.

Such attacks will surprise nearby adventurers on a roll of 1-7 (d8), or 1-5 (d6) if <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarves</a> or <a href="/creatures/gnome">gnomes</a> are present. A single khargra can swallow up to 5 pounds (50 gold pieces weight) of metal per melee round and has a capacity of 100 pounds or sometimes more.\n\n'

        'If assaulted, the khargra will fight back, annoyed at having its meal disturbed. When attacked with a metal weapon, a khargra will bite the end off and swallow it on any roll of 16 or better. They fight non-metallic opponents by delivering a powerful bite for 3-18 hit points of damage, but their attack will be merely incidental to their main objective of eating metal. They use their three strong clawed arms to grasp and pull themselves towards their prey, and at least one of the three arms must "hit" a victim before a successful bite can be inflicted on him, though the arms themselves do no damage. Once an arm has grasped, however, it will not let go until the way is clear for it to reach the metal it desires or its victim has been killed. Khargra have been known to bite right through large flesh creatures in order to reach a concentration of metal beyond. Each arm "hits" as if a creature of 12HD.\n\n'

These pebbles will reflect the creature\'s most recent diet and may be any kind of metal, including precious metal.\n\n'

Small eye-bulges protrude on either side of the top fin. The mouth is fully a foot in diameter and lined with curved, razor-sharp metal teeth which operate like an iris to open and close the mouth aperture.

Creatures struck must attempt a saving throw of 13 or better (d20) to avoid being snagged by the weapon. Creatures of man-size or less who are thus caught will be jerked off their feet and stunned for 1-4 rounds.

The bolt of electrical energy causes 6 hit points of damage per cleric or cleric/assassin to any creature struck - half that if a saving throw is made. The chance of generating such a stroke of lightning is 10% cumulative per round per kuo-toan involved. (Check each round when priests are acting in conjunction).\n\n'

Although their eyes are set on the sides of their heads, kuo-toans have excellent independent monocular vision, a very wide degree of field (180°), and they are able to detect movement even though a creature is normally invisible due to magic, astrally projected or ethereal. Thus, only complete motionlessness can avoid visual detection by a kuo-toan.

After descending vertically for 20\' or so, the shaft twists and curves, so it is impossible to see the bottom even with a <a href="/spells/light-cleric-lvl-1"><i>light</i></a> spell, which will only reveal detail of the upper parts.\n\n'
        'If brave adventurers penetrate the shaft they will eventually find the meenlock lair - a large space like a small cave at the very foot of the shaft. The creatures will always attack (exception - bright light will cause them to flee if they are able) and will use their two claws, each of which inflicts 1-4 hit points of damage. The touch of the meenlock causes <i>paralyzation</i> (saving throw applicable). At close quarters such as in their lair, however, the meenlocks\' telepathic powers are virtually useless - this is their reason for the artificial smell of rotting corpses which they deliberately create in order to deter entrance to the lair.\n\n'
        'The creatures will use considerable ingenuity to extinguish sources of light - torches, lanterns and so forth. They have a limited <a href="/spells/dimension-door-magic-user-lvl-4"><i>dimension door</i></a> ability over a distance of 6\' every other melee round - when using this ability, attacks on them are at -4 on the "to hit" roll. However they cannot use this power when carrying a victim - three meenlocks are required for such a task.\n\n'
        'It is if adventurers remove the seal from the top of the shaft but subsequently fail to penetrate the meenlocks\' lair that the creatures will take fullest advantage. When the adventurers depart, they will be followed at a safe distance by the nasty little beasts, which can climb quickly and noiselessly up the shaft by using the deadening qualities of the moss carpet. One of the adventurers will be "marked" by the meenlocks - selected at random, though if a paladin is present he will be given priority - and the meenlocks will concentrate their subsequent attacks on him alone, being highly evil and greatly desirous of wreaking vengeance on humankind. The victim selected will always be human if one is present, but if not the creatures will choose an <a href="/creatures/elf">elf</a>, <a href="/creatures/dwarf">dwarf</a> or any other near-human.\n\n'
        'From the time of his "marking" onwards, the chosen victim will receive disturbing telepathic messages; the meenlocks can communicate telepathically over a 300\' range. The messages will vary in content but the threat will be the same - that the meenlocks are pursuing the victim relentlessly and intend to make him one of them. The victim will also be conscious of stealthy movement in the shadows and of rustling, scratching noises (these will also be illusory and induced telepathically). Companions of the victim will hear and detect nothing and may conclude that their colleague is mentally aberrant.\n\n'
        'The meenlocks will not attack until the party beds down to rest. However, until that time the victim will become increasingly preoccupied with his predicament and will be able to concentrate less and less upon his adventure. His efficiency will thus be reduced, though the extent and effect of this will vary and is to be determined by the referee. As a guide, for every hour the victim is harassed by meenlocks, his strength, dexterity, intelligence and wisdom will be reduced temporarily by 1 point each, in addition he will attack at -1 on the "to hit" roll in melee and (if he is a spell-caster) victims of his spells will receive a +2 bonus on their saving throw. All these effects are cumulative but will disappear as soon as the meenlock threat has somehow been averted (if for example the party moves into an area which is brightly illuminated and which the meenlocks will not be able to enter).\n\n'
        'When the party including the victim has bedded down to rest, the meenlocks will attack, moving very silently (80% chance of obtaining surprise even against a watchful guard - 100% against a sleeper). They will attempt to silence any guards and drag their victim away (they will not attack the victim with their claws unless absolutely necessary, but they show no similar mercy to others). If they succeed in doing so, they will take the victim to their shaft, sealing it after entry. After a short but gruesome treatment, the victim himself becomes a meenlock.'

        'The creature displays a most unusual dissociative power which enables it to divide into nine individual black panthers. This transformation takes place in one segment of time and appears to be instinctive, requiring no concentration on the part of the "parent" beast. The creature will always attack a party of adventurers or any other monster it encounters, usually (90%) transforming itself as soon as its enemies are sighted and then attempting to surround the party, all nine "children" acting in co-operative fashion as though there exists some telepathic bonds between them which gives them the effective power of a corporate brain. There is only a small chance (10%) that the creature will remain in parent form before attacking, and even if this is the case the dissociation will take place after 1-2 melee rounds of combat.\n\n'
        'If one or more of the "children" are damaged during melee there is a 25% chance (check each melee round, but the chance is not cumulative) that the children will be re-associated to form the parent. This takes place by means of a <a href="/spells/blink-magic-user-lvl-3"><i>blink</i></a> operation and all the children can be re-associated so long as they are within a 50\' radius (the re-association will not take place if all children are not within a 50\' radius); the children can still engage in combat during the round of their re-association.\n\n'
        'When re-associated, the parent can <i>regenerate</i> 9 hit points each round, one for each of the offspring (if one or more of the offspring were unharmed before re-association, the hit points due to them from the <i>regeneration</i> are lost and cannot be transferred to one of their damaged brethren). Once one round of <i>regeneration</i> has taken place, the parent will again dissociate into nine (or perhaps fewer, if one has been killed) offspring; again the parent can partake in combat during the melee round of dissociation. If an offspring is killed, the body will <i>blink</i> to the parent-body when re-association takes place, but the <i>regeneration</i> has no effect on that particular individual beast, and when dissociation next takes place, there will be one fewer offspring.\n\n'
        'After the second dissociation, the whole process begins again, with a 25% chance each round that the parent will re-form if one or more of the children have been damaged.\n\n'
        'The parent beast has 9 hit dice, each child 1 die. When the creature dissociates, the parent\'s hits will be divided as equally as possible between the children (so a parent of 49 hits will divide into five children with 5 hits each and four with 6 hits each).\n\n'

It will prove extremely useful - over its years of undeath it will have acquired an extensive knowledge of the dungeon which it now roams; it will be able to guide parties to treasure and to warn them of possible dangers. Naturally, it will find some plausible reason for this knowledge and may sometimes make "deliberate mistakes" or feign ignorance of areas of which it has knowledge, in order not to arouse the suspicion of the party (whose members would naturally become suspicious if their new companion displayed near-omniscience). Having joined a party of adventurers, the penanggalan will remain with that party, even to accompanying them out of the dungeon. It will never, however, encamp for the night with the party in the dungeon, nor will it accompany them to spend the night in the supposed safety of the upper world, making some excuse for being elsewhere.\n\n'

It will always attack humans and will ignore even near-humans.\n\n'

It will make to small lacerations in the victim\'s throat and feast on the blood throughout the night. For each night\'s feeding, the victim will lose 1-6 hit points and 1 point each of strength and constitution. The penanggalan will select the same victim each night, if possible, and will continue to visit and feed night after night until the victim is dead.\n\n'
        'If the victim survives the night, he will remember none of the events except in snatches, as if from a faintly-remembered dream.

Note that hit points drained by the penanggalan cannot be restored by magical means such as <i>cure wounds</i> spells - in effect, the victim\'s maximum hits are being drained.

Similarly the victim\'s lost strength and constitution points cannot be recovered until after <i>dispel evil</i> has been cast. Once <i>dispel evil</i> has been cast, however, the hit points are restored at the rate of 1 point per day and the strength and constitution points at the rate of 1 point of each per week.\n\n'
        'If the victim succumbs on the first occasion to the penanggalan, the creature must again hypnotize him the next night before feeding is possible. However the victim\'s saving throw is progressively more difficult; the throw is made at -4 on the second occasion, -5 on the third and so on. A break in the sequence of one or more nights will halt this progression; the saving throw will again be at -3 if a renewed attempt is made by a penanggalan after a break of one or more nights.\n\n'

Furthermore, that person will be immune to further attempts by that penanggalan and will be able to recognize one - any one - for what it is, no matter in what guise it appears. He will still, however, be losing hit points at the rate of 1 point per night, as described above, if the creature has fed at least once on his blood.\n\n'
        'Note that the victim is "asleep" throughout the visitations of the penanggalan. He will never actually see the creature, even if he makes his saving throw against hypnosis. The creature will never attack a victim who is awake. If any person happens to see the head and gut when detached from the body (for example if the intended victim awakens before the creature has had time to commence hypnosis) he must save against <i>fear</i> or flee in abject terror. When in this form, however, the creature can be turned or dispelled by a cleric; treat as a <a href="/creatures/wraith">wraith</a> on the cleric/undead matrix. If the head and gut are thus turned, they must return to the lair and not venture forth again that night; if they are dispelled (a D result on the matrix) they are destroyed and the body will decay (see below). The head and gut will recoil before a strongly-presented <i>holy symbol</i> though it will not be harmed.\n\n'

If the attempt fails, no further attempts can possibly succeed. If it kills a female victim, she will rise from the grave after three days as a penanggalan (not under control of the original creature). If an attempt is made to <i>raise</i> her during that three-day period, her chances of surviving the <i>system shock</i> are half normal, and failure of that attempt means that no further attempt can possibly succeed - the process by which she becomes a penanggalan is then inexorable.\n\n'
        'If an attempt to <a href="/spells/raise-dead-cleric-lvl-5"><i>raise</i></a> any victim succeeds, however, the victim will return to normal (all hit points restored, strength and constitution back to normal) after two months of rest and recuperation; furthermore that victim will be immune to further attacks by a penanggalan and will recognize one for what it is.\n\n'
        'After the penanggalan head and gut have left the body in the lair, the internal organs swell up, whether feeding takes place or not, and cannot return to the abdomen until they have been soaked in vinegar for an hour, during which time they return to normal size. For this reason, the creature will always keep a large vessel filled with vinegar concealed in each of its lairs, and a penanggalan lair may often be detected by the distinctive odor of vinegar which permeates it.\n\n'
        'If a ray of sunlight strikes the creature\'s head and gut when they are detached from the body, the head will be paralyzed and will fall helpless to the ground until nightfall. Thus, the creature will always attempt to reunite head and body before cock-crow. In any event, if the head and body are not reunited within seven hours after initial separation, both will start to decay and the evil life-force which animates the creature will be forced to return to <i>Hell</i>. Thus, to destroy the body or the head is a sure way of destroying the creature itself.\n\n'

A wizard must exercise great care in instructing one, for it will follow orders to the letter, perverting the intent if possible, anxious for release back to its native plane.\n\n'
        'There is one explicit instruction inherent in their conjuration. If the summoner is killed, his phantom stalker(s) will instantly vanish, reappearing 1-4 hours later, intent on vengeance, having unerringly tracked the summoner\'s slayer from the <i>Ethereal Plane</i>. Phantom stalkers only gain this ethereal tracking ability upon the expiration of their masters, and it disappears as soon as the summoner\'s slayer has been tracked.\n\n'
        'Phantom stalkers have the ability to <a href="/spells/polymorph-self-magic-user-lvl-4"><i>polymorph</i></a> themselves and have been known to appear in various forms, but the most common is that of a reddish, 8\' tall humanoid with huge fiery eyes. They can <i>fly</i>, and this ability is apparently unimpaired by whatever shape they assume (though their maneuverability class will vary according to the shape).\n\n'

They are invulnerable to damage from fire, and magical <i>fire</i> attacks actually heal them 1 hit point for each attack die. However, they save against <i>cold</i> at -2 and such attacks add 1 hit point of damage for each die. If a melee is going against a phantom stalker and its death is imminent, it can cast forth its life essence in one 6-dice <a href="/spells/fireball-magic-user-lvl-3"><i>fireball</i></a>, after which it dematerializes and dies. They will sometimes simply explode the <i>fireball</i> on themselves in order to harm as many foes as possible. This is only done as a last resort and is never done if it would harm the phantom stalker\'s summoner, unless the summoner is directly and immediately responsible for the phantom stalker\'s demise (for example having ordered it to engage in a hopelessly futile and suicidal battle).'

        'These gnomes are typically armed with a non-magical +1 dagger and a non-magical +1 pick (horseman\'s pick, for purposes of damage assessment). Each individual also carries a pouch of special darts, 7-10 hand-hurled missiles of about nine inches in length, with a 40\' range and which inflicts 1-3 hit points of damage. When one of these darts strikes it is constructed so as to compact and break a small glass bead containing a gas. Any creature struck on its front parts must save against poison; if it fails, the puff of gas has reached the creature\'s system and the creature will be <i>stunned</i> on the next round and <a href="/spells/slow-magic-user-lvl-3"><i>slowed</i></a> for the four rounds following that. Deep gnomes above 3rd leve also carry 3-6 darts which contain an acid which eats a three-inch hole in armor protection in 1 round, or inflicts an additional 2-8 hit points of damage on non-protected targets (such as armor with holes, ring mail, chain mail etc.) A svirfneblin can hurl two darts in a single melee round.\n\n'

They are surprised only 1 in 12 due to their keen hearing and smelling abilities. They are likely to surprise opponents 90% of the time.\n\n'
        'All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra 5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. No illusion, phantasm, or hallucination is able to affect a sverfneblin\'s mind. Because of this and their high widom, speed and agility, they make all saving throws at +3 except against poison when their bonus is +2.\n\n'

All these small creatures can converse with speaking creatures from the <i>Elemental Plane of Earth</i> and it is 90% unlikely that any such creature will harm a svirfneblin, though the deep gnome might have to pay a heavy bribe in precious metal and gems so to escape.\n\n'

        'When being pursued by enemies, the svirfnebli will typically dash into a secret escape passage tunnelled to their size. Larger escape routes used by the deep gnomes will be filled with covered pit traps and rock deadfalls. A gnome leader is 75% likely to carry 3-12 small rock-like containers, and these will be strewn in the path of pursuing foes if no handy escape route is nearby. These crystals are crushed when stepped on by any creature weighing more than 100 pounds, and each releases a cloud of poison gas of about 10\' diameter and 15\' height. Any creature passing through such a gas cloud must save versus poison or lose consciousness for 1-12 turns. The gas cloud dissipates in 2 rounds.\n\n'
        'Deep gnomes will usually aid any non-enemy for a fee, and they will certainly help in fighting drow, kuo-toans or mind flayers, providing there is a reasonable chance of defeating these mortal enemies. They love gems and will take great risks in order to gain them.\n\n'

In attacking, it will use two of its arms in an attempt to grapple its victim, while using the other two (which might carry weapons) to subdue. The subduing attacks are resolved in the same way as attacks to subdue a dragon. Upon announcement of intent to <i>strike to subdue</i>, all hit points of damage scored by attacks on the victim (from the two subduing arms) are considered non-fatal battering/bruising damage.

        'The grappling attacks are normal; both grappling arms must score a hit for the grapple to be successful, otherwise it is assumed that the victim has been able to avoid being grappled. However if the victim has previously been subdued, the grappling attack will always succeed in the next melee round. If the xill succeeds in grappling a victim, it will then inject a paralyzing fluid into his bloodstream through its claws, (normal saving throw applicable) in the next melee round. Victims grappled thus have one melee round to break free before the fluid is injected, and they may attempt to do so by "saving against strength" - a d20 is rolled, and if the result is lower than the victim\'s strength, he has escaped from the clutches of the xill.\n\n'
        'In summary, the xill attempts to grapple and paralyze the victim, or to subdue and grapple him. Once either of these results has been achieved, it will attempt to become <i>Ethereal</i> (and its power to do so will extend to its paralyzed/subdued victim) and carry the victim to its lair on the <i>Ethereal Plane</i> to inject the eggs. During this two-melee-round transitory period when the xill and its victim are turning <i>ethereal</i>, the xill cannot move, it is vulnerable to magic (i.e. its magic resistance is reduced to zero) and can be hit by weapons at -3 hit probability. When the transition is complete, however, the creature can only be attacked ethereally and its normal magic resistance is restored.\n\n'

Intelligent, it hates most land-going life and seeks methods to enslave or destroy the beings of the surface world. The race is extremely long-lived and has collected a great deal of knowledge more ancient than man. It is perhaps better that men do not know these ancient secrets, for these are rumored to be more horrible and foul than could be thought possible.\n\n'
        'An aboleth has a slime covered fish-like body with a large fluke-like tail which propels it through the water. It is a blue-green mottled gray in color with a pinkish tan belly. It has blue-black slime-producing organs on either side. Set in its head are 3 long, slit-like, purple-red eyes, one above the other. Over the eyes are protective ridges. Four 10-foot long tentacles grow from the top of its head, and its toothless mouth is located on the underside. On land, an aboleth pulls its obscene mass about with its 4 tentacles.\n\n'
        'In combat the aboleth attacks with its 4 tentacles for 1-6 points of damage each. Any creature struck by its tentacles must save vs. spells or the creature\'s skin will change into a clear, slimy membrane in 2-5 rounds. This change can be stopped if a <a href="/spells/cure-disease-cleric-lvl-3"><i>cure disease</i></a> spell is cast on the victim. Once the change is complete, the membrane must be kept damp with cool water or the victim will take 1-12 points of damage each turn because of intense pain. A <a href="/spells/cure-serious-wounds-cleric-lvl-4"><i>cure serious wounds</i></a> spell will change the membrane back to normal skin.\n\n'
        'The aboleth is highly intelligent and can create very realistic illusions with audible and visual components if it concentrates and does nothing else. It can also try to enslave other creatures 3 times per day. This ability can be used only against a single creature up to 30 feet away. The victim must save vs. spells or be filled with desire to serve the aboleth. Enslaved creatures will not fight for the aboleth but will attempt to follow any other telepathic commands. If an enslaved character is separated from the aboleth by more than a mile, a new saving throw may be made each day. This charm can be broken by <a href="/spells/remove-curse-cleric-lvl-3"><i>remove curse</i></a> or <a href="/spells/dispel-magic-cleric-lvl-3"><i>dispel magic</i></a> spells or the death of the enslaving aboleth.\n\n'

However, the aboleth uses its mucus to give its slaves the power to breathe water. Thus, its slaves will have the ability to breathe water, as a <i>potion of water breathing</i>, for 1-3 hours. The mucus may be dissolved by soap or wine.\n\n'

While able to attack by bite (5-20) or by striking with its 2 flippers (for 1d12 each), the creature usually attacks surface prey by swimming rapidly around it in closing circles, starting 100 feet out and closing at 20 feet per round to 40 feet. From its usual 15" rate, the circling afanc propels itself at ever-faster speed, until a rate of as much as 30" or more is attained. This swimming creates a whirlpool of size and power sufficient to draw down a ship of small to small-medium size (up to 60 feet in length). Ships will be dragged to the bottom at a rate of 10 feet per round. It will avoid larger ships. As it takes some 5-8 rounds for the circling afanc to create the whirlpool, and because the monster must be at the surface to do so, concerted attack by spells and/or heavy missile fire might drive the creature off. Creatures dragged down are subject to attack as the afanc is 10% likely to submerge and try either some other mode of attack or seek easier prey. Of course, rafts, boats, and similar small craft (30 feet or less in length) are typically rushed, knocked so as to capsize, and the passengers consumed by the greedy beast.\n\n'

At times, however, a barghest will spawn, and its litter of 6 will be sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow. Those which survive will eventually return to Gehenna, but while they are yet young they must feed upon the lives of men. Barghest whelps will be found alone or in pairs on the Prime Material Plane, generally living near isolated communities of humans or with bands of <a href="/creatures/goblin">goblins</a>.\n\n'

Their natural shape is very much the same as that of a large <a href="/creatures/goblin">goblin</a>, and when barghests dwell amongst goblins, they retain their normal form. While goblins recognize and worship barghests, other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these goblins. Their goblin hosts fear and serve barghests, going to great lengths to bring them human sacrifices. The barghests, in turn, slay the powerful enemies of the goblins and generally enrich the treasure possessed by their hosts.\n\n'

(Zero level humans gain barghests only one-half an energy level, so they are less desirable prey than are exceptional persons.) Likewise, as hit dice are gained, the barghest also becomes more powerful. Its armor class increases by 1 place with each additional hit die, and its strength grows from an initial 18/00 to 24; damage increases accordingly, as does magic resistance and intelligence. When a barghest eventually attains full growth and power, it is able to shift itself to the Planes of Gehenna, where it will search out its own reeking valley rift.\n\n'

Its adult skin color is blue. The eyes of the barghest are glowing orange when it is excited, but otherwise they are indistinguishable from those of a goblin. Their canine forms can be those of any typical large dogs, and in these forms it is almost (95%) impossible to tell them from normal dogs, except that other dogs will fear and hate them, attacking at every opportunity.'

The transformation takes 1 turn, and once started it will not cease even if the barkburr is killed and/or removed. Most of the victim\'s equipment close to his body (clothes, armor, etc.) is enclosed by bark, but some (e.g., a sword, a shield or a ring) may remain hanging from a branch or be caught in the roots. Of the gear which is enclosed, all but magical items, gold, silver, platinum, and gems will be absorbed into the wood of the tree over a period of 2-7 hours.\n\n'
        'A barkburr may be removed from its victim (before or after lignification has set in) by killing it, applying fire, or by force. Attacks on the barkburr are made against its armor class 0 carapace, and attacks which miss should be rolled again against the victim\'s armor class. The application of fire has a 15% cumulative chance per round of dislodging the barkburr, which takes only 1 point of fire damage per round from fire applied to the outer carapace, but the victim will take fire damage unless protected. It is not possible to remove a barkburr by pulling it directly away from the victim, but pulling or pushing it sideways will succeed if a roll of 5d10 is less than the total strength being applied. This latter method will inflict 1-10 points of damage on the character, if successful, as the barbed poison needle is torn out. A maximum of 3 people, including the victim, can act together to attempt to remove a barkburr in this way.\n\n'
        'On the ground a barkburr is almost helpless; unable to leap from this position, it can crawl at 1/2" and is easily flipped over to reveal its armor class 8 underside. Fire applied to the underside inflicts normal damage.\n\n'
        'Since they have no minds as such, barkburrs are immune to spells such as <a href="/spells/charm-monster-magic-user-lvl-4"><i>charm monster</i></a> or <a href="/spells/sleep-magic-user-lvl-1"><i>sleep</i></a>.\n\n'
        'Once lignification has set in the barkburr will cease injecting poison and use the victim as a platform from which to launch an attack on any other eligible victim within 20 feet. Note, however, that a barkburr is only capable of injecting poison for a total of 2 rounds plus 1 round per hit die each day. Note also that the poison is only effective if injected by a barkburr.\n\n'
        'Once lignified, a creature begins a further transformation into a form which is safe from the point of view of the wood. This process takes as many days as the victim has level or hit dice, and during this time the victim remains helpless in tree form (having armor class 10 and its original number of hit points). At the end of the period the victim either remains fixed in its tree form or undergoes a rapid metamorphosis into a woodland creature or a druid. The final form adopted is determined by rolling a percentile die and consulting the following table:\n\n'

        'A creature who adopts any final form other than that of the druid will have no desire to leave the wood and will resist attempts to make him do so.\n\n'
        'Only a full <a href="/spells/wish-magic-user-lvl-9"><i>wish</i></a> will restore a creature to its original form once the transformation is completed.

Its mouth is small but the fangs therein are razor-sharp, and the damage from burning affects the victim more than the blood drain (hence 2-8 points of damage per round). The skin of the fire bat is tough and leathery, and even the relatively thin wings are difficult to pierce.\n\n'

How they travel to the Prime Material Plane is a mystery, but some sages have speculated that when <a href="/creatures/fire-elemental">fire elementals</a> are summoned, once in a great while some fire bats will appear with them; and woe to the conjurer, for the fire bats are not under the mage\'s control at all! Fire bats reproduce by fission after gorging themselves on blood, so even 1 fire bat escaping into this plane can start a colony and can replace any casualties. A fire bat colony will not grow very large, however, for they will instinctively limit they population to the available food supply.\n\n'
        'When fire bats engage an opponent, they make swooping attacks as they attempt to attach themselves to the victim. Once they have attached themselves, fire bats do not need to roll for further attacks and will automatically burn and bleed their victims for a total of 3 rounds (the first round they scored a hit plus 2 more rounds). At the end of 3 rounds, the satiated fire bat will drop off and return to its lair. If the victim dies before 3 rounds are over, the unsatiated fire bats will attack other opponents to finish feeding (but will never drain more than 3 rounds\' worth of blood whether from 1, 2, or 3 victims). Fire bats can detect invisible opponents because of an advanced sonar sense and infravision; they attack invisible targets without penalty. Unlike ordinary <a href="/creatures/bat">bats</a>, fire bats are not harmed by sunlight (or other bright lights) and can see within the normal vision range quite well.

If the number of fire bats ever falls below 25% of their starting force (whether from casualties or satisfied returnees), the fire bats will all instantly withdraw and attempt to escape to their lair. If cornered in their lair, they will fight ferociously to the death. When they die, a burst of flame envelopes them and their physical bodies are transported back to the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they are reborn.\n\n'
        'The lair of a fire bat colony tends to be rocky and cavelike, with many exits and labyrinthine passages but only one large, easily noticeable entrance. Treasure is likely to be in the form of gems and jewelry. because fire bats love sparkling stones and especially prize rubies, jacinths, and carnelians. One or 2 young fire bats (under 1 year old) may be found in the lair if a hunting pack is destroyed, and each young fire bat will have one-half the hit dice and damage per attack of an adult.\n\n'
        'Fire bats move by an awkward hop-walk on the ground or (more effeciently) by flight. Fire bats use true flight and not gliding, because hot internal gases lighten them a great deal. Water scares fire bats, but it takes a minimum of 10 gallons of cool water to douse 1 fire bat\'s external fires. Once extinguished, it requires 10 rounds of drying off before the fire bat can ignite again. During this period it cannot fly, and will only do 1-4 points of damage if it attacks successfully. Fire bats can glide through hot solutions (including lava and magma) at their flying speed, for they are at home in anything involving fire.'

Upon sensing the approach of prey, a bowler rolls towards its victim, gaining 1" of speed per round of combat, until a maximum move of 15" is achieved. (The vibrations of its own movement enable the monster to detect and avoid walls, pits, etc.) The bowler\'s attack form is to roll over and crush victims. The weight of the bowler is approximately 28 pounds per hit point. After crushing prey, a bowler rolls back onto the victim and a mouth-like orifice opens to consume flesh and bone, shell, etc. Each bowler has a central core of a single beryl gem worth a base of 10 gp. Bowlers will roll quietly at first, so there is only a 50% chance that prey will notice them before they are within 40 feet of their intended victim(s).

        'A cloaker resembles a large semicircular cloak or blanket with two claw-like appendages at the tips and a long, mace-like tail.

In the middle of its front is a large gaping mouth and 2 glowing red eyespots. Because of all of its eyes a cloaker cannot be surprised by an attack from the rear side. Cloakers are lightweight and can fly at a rate of 15" or creep with their claws along walls at 1".\n\n'
        'Cloakers attack by flying at a character and wrapping the victim in their folds, pinning the victim\'s arms, and preventing the victim from returning the attack. Once a character is wrapped a cloaker may then bite at the victim\'s belly or back; points of damage done are 1-4 plus the unadjusted armor class of the victim. The cloaker may normally strike with its tail twice per round for 1-6 points of damage. It often uses its tail to fend off attackers while slaying its enveloped victim. The tail is armor class 1 and can take 16 points of damage before being cut off.\n\n'
        'Any attacks on the cloaker while it is wrapped around a victim will cause half-damage to the victim and half-damage to the cloaker. Area effect attacks such as a fire-based spell will cause full damage to both victim and cloaker.\n\n'
        'Cloakers regularly emit a subsonic moaning. The effects of this moaning are blocked by stone. Cloakers may not bite and moan at the same time. This moaning can cause several effects as the monster desires. The lowest intensity level of moaning causes nervousness and unease to all who are within range. It will numb the minds of those who listen to it for more than 6 consecutive turns, making them zombie-like. Anyone within hearing range of this moaning will fight at -2 to hit and damage. This effect has a range of 80 feet.\n\n'
