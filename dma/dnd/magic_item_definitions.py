Any spell cast at an individual will usually rebound, in part or perhaps in whole, upon the spell caster. The distance between, and area occupied by, the victim (the ring wearer) and the spell caster are not as they seem when the magic activates the <i>spell turning</i> ring. Three important exceptions must be noted:\n\n'
        '1. Spells which affect an area, and which are not cast directly at the ring wearer, are not turned by the ring.\n\n'
        '2. Spells which are delivered by touch are not turned.\n\n'
        '3. Magic contained in devices (rods, staves, wands, rings, and other items) which are triggered without spell casting are not turned. Note: a scroll spell is <i>not</i> considered a device.\n\n'
        'When a spell is cast at an individual wearing a <i>ring of spell turning</i> percentile dice are rolled and rounded to the nearest decimal, i.e. 1-5 is dropped, 6-9 adds 10, so 05 equals 0%, but 96 equals 100%. The score of the percentile dice indicates what portion of the spell has been turned back upon its caster.\n\n'
        'Damage is determined and awarded proportionally. Saving throws (for both opponents) are adjusted upwards by +1 for each 10% below 100%, i.e. 80% = +2, 70% = +3, ... 10% = +9. Even with such adjustments in saving throw it is possible that both target individual and spell caster will end up polymorphed into bullfrogs!\n\n'
        '<b>Note Regarding Ring of Spell Turning</b>: Unless the percentile dice score for the <i>turning</i> effect is 09 or less or 91 or more, this ring will allow a saving throw against spells which normally have none. The effect of the save will be to negate or inflict half normal damage as appropriate to the spell in question. For each 10% of the spell <i>turned</i>, allow a 5% chance (1 in 20) to save. Thus, if 11-19 is rolled, a roll of 20 saves, 20-29 allows a 19-20 to save, 30-39 allows 18-20, and so on. Example: An illusionist casts a <a href="/spells/maze-illusionist-lvl-5"><i>maze</i></a> spell upon a fighter wearing a <i>ring of spell turning</i>. The <i>maze</i> spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 34% of the spell effect. The fighter has a 15% chance to save against the spell (34% on the <i>turning</i>); otherwise it will take full normal effect. The illusionist mmust also save (100% - 34% = 66%, or 6 10% increments, which converts to a 30% chance to save) by rolling a 15-20 or be <i>mazed</i> also. Saving in this case will negate spell effect. This special saving throw is NOT modified by race, magic items, or any other condition, including existing spells.\n\n'
