Thus, if 11-19 is rolled, a roll of 20 saves, 20-29 allows a 19-20 to save, 30-39 allows 18-20, and so on. Example: An illusionist casts a <a href="/spells/maze-illusionist-lvl-5"><i>maze</i></a> spell upon a fighter wearing a <i>ring of spell turning</i>. The <i>maze</i> spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 34% of the spell effect.

The illusionist mmust also save (100% - 34% = 66%, or 6 10% increments, which converts to a 30% chance to save) by rolling a 15-20 or be <i>mazed</i> also. Saving in this case will negate spell effect. This special saving throw is NOT modified by race, magic items, or any other condition, including existing spells.\n\n'

Range is 6" +1" per clerical level of the user. The number of insects produced is 60 plus 10 per level. Every 10 insects will inflict 1 point of damage upon the target victim, regardless of armor class, unless the victim is protected by a force field, engulfed in flames, etc. Note, however, that the insects will not affect creatures larger than man-sized with a natural armor class of 5 or better. When a vulnerable target is attacked by the swarm of flying insects, the creature will be unable to do anything other than attempt to dislodge/kill the things. The insect attack lasts for 1 round.
